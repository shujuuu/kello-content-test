Accounts Payable refers to the system responsible for managing the company's obligations to pay off short-term debts to its creditors or suppliers.

It involves tracking invoices, approving payments, and ensuring that all outgoing payments are made accurately and on time.

The Accounts Payable system generates reports and handles bank-specific EDI transactions to facilitate these payments.

It also includes the generation of standard SBP payment slips, which are used for processing payments.

The source code for the Accounts Payable functionality is located in the <SwmPath>[src/cxp/](src/cxp/)</SwmPath> directory, which contains various COBOL programs that implement different aspects of the Accounts Payable process.
