title: Accounts Receivable Overview
---
Accounts Receivable refers to the outstanding invoices a company has or the money clients owe the company. It is a crucial part of the business operations management system.

Accounts Receivable is used to manage and track customer invoices, ensuring that payments are collected on time. This includes generating invoices, sending reminders, and recording payments.

The system automates the process of handling accounts receivable, reducing manual effort and minimizing errors. It helps in maintaining accurate financial records and improving cash flow management.

In Kello Imagens, the Accounts Receivable functionality is implemented through various COBOL programs located in the <SwmPath>[src/crp/](src/crp/)</SwmPath> directory. These programs handle different aspects of the accounts receivable process, such as invoice generation, payment processing, and reporting.
