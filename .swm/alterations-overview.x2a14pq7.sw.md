title: Alterations Overview
---
Alterations refer to modifications or updates made to the system's functionality or data processing routines.

These modifications are implemented through COBOL programs located in the <SwmPath>[src/alt/](src/alt/)</SwmPath> directory.

Each COBOL program in this directory is responsible for a specific alteration task, such as updating records, generating reports, or processing transactions.

The alterations ensure that the system remains up-to-date with business requirements and operational needs.

## Purpose of Alterations

Alterations ensure that the system remains up-to-date with business requirements and operational needs. They are essential for maintaining the relevance and efficiency of the system as business processes evolve.

## Implementing Alterations

Alterations are implemented through COBOL programs located in the <SwmPath>[src/alt/](src/alt/)</SwmPath> directory. Each program is designed to handle a specific task, such as updating records, generating reports, or processing transactions. This modular approach allows for targeted updates and modifications without disrupting the entire system.
