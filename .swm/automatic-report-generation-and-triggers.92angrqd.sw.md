title: Automatic Report Generation and Triggers
---
This document will cover the process of generating automatic reports in the Kello Imagens system, which includes:

1. How automatic reports are generated
2. What triggers the generation of these reports.

# How automatic reports are generated

Automatic reports in the Kello Imagens system are generated using COBOL-85 programs. These programs are designed to collect data from various sources within the system, process it, and format it into a report. The reports can include various types of business data such as sales figures, inventory levels, and financial transactions. The generation process typically involves reading data from databases, performing calculations, and then writing the results to a report file.

# How automatic reports are generated

The `generate_report` function is responsible for collecting data and formatting it into a report. It reads data from the database, processes it, and writes the results to a report file.

# What triggers the generation of these reports

The generation of automatic reports can be triggered by various events within the Kello Imagens system. Common triggers include the completion of a business process, such as the end of a sales day, or the receipt of new data, such as an updated inventory list. Additionally, reports can be scheduled to run at specific times or intervals using a scheduling system. This ensures that reports are generated regularly and consistently, providing up-to-date information for business operations.

# What triggers the generation of these reports

The `report_trigger` function is responsible for initiating the report generation process. It can be called by various events or scheduled tasks within the system.
