This document will cover the orchestration of automatic report generation, which includes:

1. The purpose of automatic report generation
2. How the process is initiated
3. The data flow and processing steps
4. Final report generation and output.

# The purpose of automatic report generation

Automatic report generation in Kello Imagens is designed to streamline the creation of business reports. This feature ensures that reports are generated consistently and accurately without manual intervention, saving time and reducing errors.

# How the process is initiated

The process of automatic report generation is typically initiated by a scheduled task or a trigger event within the system. This could be based on a specific time, such as the end of a business day, or an event, such as the completion of a transaction.

# The data flow and processing steps

Once initiated, the system gathers the necessary data from various sources within the application. This data is then processed according to predefined rules and templates. The processing steps include data validation, aggregation, and formatting to ensure the final report meets the required standards.

# The data flow and processing steps

The main logic for data gathering and processing is implemented in the `generate_report` function. This function collects data from different modules, processes it, and prepares it for report generation.

# Final report generation and output

After processing the data, the system generates the final report. This report can be in various formats such as PDF, Excel, or plain text, depending on the requirements. The generated report is then stored in a designated location and can be automatically sent to relevant stakeholders via email or other communication channels.

# Final report generation and output

The `output_report` function handles the final steps of report generation, including formatting the report and saving it to the specified location.
