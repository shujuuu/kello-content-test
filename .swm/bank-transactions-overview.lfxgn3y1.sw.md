title: Bank Transactions Overview
---
Bank transactions refer to the electronic data interchange (EDI) processes that handle financial operations between the business and banks.

These transactions include generating and processing payment slips, managing bank-specific transaction formats, and ensuring compliance with banking standards.

The system supports various banks, as evidenced by the multiple COBOL source files named after different banks in the <SwmPath>[src/banks/](src/banks/)</SwmPath> directory.

Each bank-specific file contains the logic required to interact with that particular bank's systems, ensuring seamless financial operations.

## Bank-Specific Files

The <SwmPath>[src/banks/](src/banks/)</SwmPath> directory contains COBOL source files named after different banks, each containing the logic required to interact with that particular bank's systems.
