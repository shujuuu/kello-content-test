title: Banking Operations Overview
---
Banking operations refer to the processes and transactions related to managing financial activities within the system.

These operations include generating bank-specific EDI transactions, which facilitate electronic data interchange between the system and banking institutions.

The system also supports the generation of standard SBP payment slips, which are used for processing payments.

Various COBOL source files in the <SwmPath>[src/cbp/](src/cbp/)</SwmPath> directory handle different aspects of these banking operations, ensuring that financial transactions are processed accurately and efficiently.
