title: Basic concepts of Extended COBOL in Cooperative Operations
---
Extended COBOL refers to the use of additional features and functionalities beyond the standard COBOL-85 language. These extensions are used to enhance the capabilities of the COBOL programs.

In Cooperative Operations, Extended COBOL includes the use of special classes, such as the `Window` class, which allows for graphical user interface elements within COBOL programs.

Extended COBOL also involves the use of various `COPY` statements to include external files and modules, which modularizes the code and promotes reusability.

The `SPECIAL-NAMES` clause is used to define system-specific features, such as the decimal point representation and printer assignments, which are part of the Extended COBOL functionalities.

Extended COBOL supports object-oriented programming concepts, as seen with the `invoke` statements used to call methods on objects, enhancing the procedural nature of traditional COBOL.
