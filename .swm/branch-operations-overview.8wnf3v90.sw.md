title: Branch Operations Overview
---
Branch operations refer to the various functionalities and processes related to managing different branches within the Kello Imagens system.

These operations include creating, updating, and deleting branch records, as well as handling specific transactions and reports associated with each branch.

The <SwmPath>[src/galho/](src/galho/)</SwmPath> directory contains numerous COBOL source files that implement these branch-related functionalities.

Each file in the <SwmPath>[src/galho/](src/galho/)</SwmPath> directory typically corresponds to a specific operation or set of operations for branch management, such as <SwmPath>[src/galho/GalhoCRD020.cbl](src/galho/GalhoCRD020.cbl)</SwmPath> for creating branch records or <SwmPath>[src/galho/galhoBxVdLot.cbl](src/galho/galhoBxVdLot.cbl)</SwmPath> for handling batch transactions.

These COBOL programs interact with the database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on branch data, ensuring that the system maintains accurate and up-to-date information about each branch.

Additionally, branch operations may include generating reports and handling electronic data interchange (EDI) transactions specific to each branch, facilitating smooth business operations.

## CRUD Operations

The file <SwmPath>[src/galho/GalhoCRD020.cbl](src/galho/GalhoCRD020.cbl)</SwmPath> is used for creating branch records.

```cobol
         IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
```

## Batch Transactions

The file <SwmPath>[src/galho/galhoBxVdLot.cbl](src/galho/galhoBxVdLot.cbl)</SwmPath> handles batch transactions for branches.

```cobol
       COPY DSLANG.CPY.
```
