# Overview of business rules in report listings

Business rules in report listings are the predefined criteria and logic that determine how data is filtered, sorted, and displayed in reports. These rules ensure that the reports generated meet the specific requirements of the business and provide accurate and relevant information.

# How business rules are implemented in the code

In the Kello Imagens system, business rules for report listings are implemented using COBOL-85. The code applies various conditions and logic to the data before generating the final report. This includes filtering data based on specific criteria, sorting the data in a particular order, and formatting the data to match the report's requirements.

# How business rules are implemented in the code

The following code snippet demonstrates how business rules are applied in the report generation process. The code filters the data based on specific criteria and sorts it before generating the report.

# Examples of business rules in action

Here are some examples of business rules that might be applied in report listings:

1. **Date Range Filtering**: Only include records within a specific date range.
2. **Status Filtering**: Only include records with a specific status (e.g., 'Completed', 'Pending').
3. **Sorting**: Sort the records by date, customer name, or transaction amount.
4. **Aggregation**: Calculate totals, averages, or other aggregate values for specific fields.
