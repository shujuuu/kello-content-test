title: Cash Handling Overview
---
Cash Handling refers to the processes and procedures involved in managing cash transactions within the Kello Imagens system.

It includes the recording, tracking, and reconciliation of cash inflows and outflows to ensure accurate financial reporting.

The system automates various aspects of cash handling, such as generating reports and managing bank-specific EDI transactions.

Cash Handling also involves the generation of standard SBP payment slips, which are used for processing payments.

The COBOL-85 programs in the <SwmPath>[src/chp/](src/chp/)</SwmPath> directory likely contain the logic and operations related to these cash handling tasks.

## Automated Cash Handling
