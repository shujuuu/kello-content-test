title: Compilation Process for Source and Object Files
---
This document will cover the compilation process for source and object files, which includes:

1. Understanding source files
2. Understanding object files
3. The compilation process

# Understanding source files

Source files in the Kello Imagens project are written in COBOL-85. These files contain the human-readable code that developers write and maintain. Source files typically have extensions like `.cbl` or `.cob` and are stored in the repository's source directories. They include the business logic, data definitions, and procedural code necessary for the application's functionality.

# Understanding object files

Object files are the result of compiling source files. These files are in machine code, which the computer's processor can execute directly. Object files typically have extensions like `.obj` or `.o`. They are not human-readable and are used as intermediate files in the build process before linking them into executable programs.

# The compilation process

The compilation process in the Kello Imagens project involves several steps to transform source files into object files and eventually into executable programs.

# The compilation process

The script `compile.sh` is used to compile the COBOL source files into object files. It invokes the COBOL compiler with the appropriate flags and options to generate the object files from the source files.

The script `link.sh` is used to link the object files into an executable program. It takes the object files generated by the compilation process and combines them into a single executable file.
