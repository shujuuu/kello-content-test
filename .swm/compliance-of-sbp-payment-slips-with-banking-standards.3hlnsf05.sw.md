title: Compliance of SBP Payment Slips with Banking Standards
---
This document will cover how the system ensures that SBP payment slips comply with banking standards. We'll cover:

1. Generating SBP payment slips
2. Validating compliance with banking standards
3. Handling errors and exceptions

# Generating SBP payment slips

The system generates SBP payment slips by following a predefined format that includes all necessary fields such as payer information, payment amount, due date, and bank details. This format is designed to meet the requirements set by banking standards.

# Generating SBP payment slips

The code in this section outlines the structure of the SBP payment slip, ensuring that all required fields are included and formatted correctly.

# Validating compliance with banking standards

Once the SBP payment slip is generated, the system performs a series of validation checks to ensure compliance with banking standards. These checks include verifying the format of the payment slip, ensuring that all mandatory fields are filled, and validating the data against predefined rules.

# Validating compliance with banking standards

This section of the code performs validation checks on the generated SBP payment slip to ensure it meets banking standards.

# Handling errors and exceptions

If any validation checks fail, the system handles errors and exceptions by logging the issues and notifying the user. The user can then correct the errors and regenerate the payment slip.

# Handling errors and exceptions

This section of the code handles errors and exceptions that occur during the validation process, ensuring that any issues are logged and communicated to the user.
