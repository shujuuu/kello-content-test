# Creating a branch

The <SwmToken path="src/galho/GalhoCRD020B.cbl" pos="49:1:3" line-data="       PROCEDURE DIVISION.">`PROCEDURE DIVISION`</SwmToken> in <SwmPath>[src/galho/GalhoCRD020B.cbl](src/galho/GalhoCRD020B.cbl)</SwmPath> starts the main process section and accepts parameters from the command line. This is where the creation of a branch would be initiated.

```cobol
       PROCEDURE DIVISION.
       MAIN-PROCESS SECTION.
           ACCEPT PARAMETROS-W FROM COMMAND-LINE.
