This document will cover the calculations performed on the contract data, which includes:

1. identifying the types of calculations
2. understanding the purpose of these calculations
3. examining the code responsible for these calculations.

# Identifying the types of calculations

The contract data undergoes several types of calculations to ensure accurate financial reporting and compliance with business rules. These calculations typically include interest calculations, payment schedules, and balance adjustments.

# Understanding the purpose of these calculations

The primary purpose of performing calculations on contract data is to maintain accurate financial records, generate reports, and ensure compliance with contractual obligations. These calculations help in determining the amount owed by clients, the interest accrued over time, and the adjustments needed for any discrepancies.

# Examining the code responsible for these calculations

The code snippet below shows a section where interest calculations are performed on the contract data. The function `calculate_interest` takes the principal amount and the interest rate to compute the interest accrued over a specified period.

This section of the code handles the generation of payment schedules. The function `generate_payment_schedule` calculates the payment amounts and due dates based on the contract terms.

Here, balance adjustments are made to account for any discrepancies in the contract data. The function `adjust_balance` ensures that the final balance reflects all payments and adjustments accurately.
