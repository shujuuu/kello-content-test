# Initializing the Program

The initialization phase sets up the initial state of the program. This includes setting up necessary variables and preparing the environment for the main processing logic. This step ensures that the program has all the required resources and configurations to run smoothly. For the end user, this means that the program will start correctly and be ready to handle their requests without any issues.

# Main Processing Logic

The main processing logic is the core of the CXP100 program. It evaluates various conditions and performs corresponding actions. For example, it creates list views for cheques and receivables, verifies loan data, and handles user interactions. This section ensures that all business operations are executed correctly. For the end user, this means that their interactions with the system, such as viewing lists or verifying data, will be handled efficiently and accurately.

# Saving Data

The saving data phase handles the persistence of data. It checks if there are any modifications to be saved, processes the data accordingly, and writes it to the appropriate storage. This step ensures that all changes made during the session are recorded and any necessary logs are updated. For the end user, this means that their data will be saved correctly, and they can trust that their changes are not lost.
