---
This document will cover how the system ensures compliance with different banking standards. We'll cover:

1. Overview of compliance requirements
2. Implementation of EDI transactions
3. Generation of standard SBP payment slips

# Overview of compliance requirements

The system is designed to comply with various banking standards to ensure smooth and secure financial transactions. Compliance is achieved through the implementation of specific features such as EDI transactions and SBP payment slip generation. These features are tailored to meet the requirements of different banks and financial institutions.

# Implementation of EDI transactions

The file `edi_transactions.cbl` contains the COBOL code responsible for handling Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transactions. This ensures that the system can communicate with different banks using their specific EDI standards.

# Generation of standard SBP payment slips

The file `sbp_payment_slips.cbl` includes the code for generating standard SBP payment slips. This functionality ensures that the payment slips generated by the system comply with the standard formats required by banks.
