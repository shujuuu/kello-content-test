title: Error Handling and Recovery Mechanisms in Bank Transactions
---
This document will cover how error handling and recovery mechanisms are implemented in the Kello Imagens system. We'll cover:

1. Error detection and logging
2. Error handling strategies
3. Recovery mechanisms.

# Error detection and logging

Error detection in Kello Imagens is primarily achieved through the use of COBOL's built-in error handling capabilities. When an error occurs, it is logged for further analysis. This logging is crucial for understanding the nature of the error and for debugging purposes.

# Error detection and logging

The code snippet shows how errors are detected and logged. The `DISPLAY` statement is used to output error messages, which are then written to a log file for further analysis.

# Error handling strategies

Once an error is detected, Kello Imagens employs several strategies to handle it. These strategies include retry mechanisms, user notifications, and fallback procedures. The goal is to ensure that the system can continue to operate smoothly even in the presence of errors.

# Error handling strategies

This section of the code demonstrates a retry mechanism. If an operation fails, the system will attempt to retry it a specified number of times before giving up and logging the error.

# Recovery mechanisms

Recovery mechanisms are put in place to restore the system to a stable state after an error has occurred. This includes rolling back transactions, resetting system states, and cleaning up resources. These mechanisms ensure that the system can recover gracefully from errors and continue to function correctly.

# Recovery mechanisms

The code snippet shows how the system rolls back transactions to maintain data integrity. This is a crucial part of the recovery process.
