title: Error handling and recovery mechanisms in the backup process
---
This document will cover the error handling and recovery mechanisms implemented in the Kello Imagens system, which includes:

1. Error Logging
2. Error Notification
3. Error Recovery

# Error Logging

Error logging is a crucial part of the error handling mechanism. It ensures that all errors are recorded for future analysis and debugging. In Kello Imagens, errors are logged with detailed information including the error type, message, and stack trace. This helps in identifying the root cause of the error and taking corrective actions.

# Error Logging

The `log_error` procedure logs the error details into a log file. It captures the error type, message, and stack trace for future analysis.

# Error Notification

Error notification is another important aspect of error handling. It ensures that the relevant stakeholders are informed about the errors as soon as they occur. In Kello Imagens, error notifications are sent via email to the support team. This allows for quick response and resolution of the issues.

# Error Notification

The `notify_error` procedure sends an email notification to the support team with the error details. This ensures that the support team is aware of the issues and can take immediate action.

# Error Recovery

Error recovery mechanisms are implemented to ensure that the system can recover from errors and continue functioning. In Kello Imagens, error recovery involves retrying the failed operations and rolling back transactions to maintain data integrity. This ensures that the system remains stable and reliable even in the face of errors.

# Error Recovery

The `recover_error` procedure handles the recovery process. It retries the failed operations and rolls back transactions if necessary to maintain data integrity.
