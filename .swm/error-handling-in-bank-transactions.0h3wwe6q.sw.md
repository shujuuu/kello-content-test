title: Error Handling in Bank Transactions
---
This document will cover how error handling is implemented in bank transactions, which includes:

1. Identifying potential errors
2. Implementing error handling mechanisms
3. Logging and reporting errors.

# Identifying potential errors

In the context of bank transactions, potential errors can arise from various sources such as network issues, incorrect data formats, or transaction failures. Identifying these potential errors is the first step in implementing robust error handling.

# Implementing error handling mechanisms

Error handling mechanisms are implemented to catch and manage these errors effectively. This typically involves using COBOL's `ON ERROR` and `USE AFTER EXCEPTION` constructs to handle exceptions that occur during transaction processing. For example, if a transaction fails due to a network issue, the error handling code will attempt to retry the transaction or log the error for further investigation.

# Implementing error handling mechanisms

The following code snippet demonstrates how error handling is implemented in a COBOL program for bank transactions. The `ON ERROR` clause is used to catch any errors that occur during the execution of the transaction.

# Logging and reporting errors

Once an error is caught, it is essential to log the error details for auditing and troubleshooting purposes. This involves writing the error information to a log file or a database. Additionally, the system may generate reports to notify administrators or support teams about the errors, enabling them to take corrective actions promptly.

# Logging and reporting errors

The following code snippet shows how errors are logged in a COBOL program. The error details, including the error code and message, are written to a log file for further analysis.
