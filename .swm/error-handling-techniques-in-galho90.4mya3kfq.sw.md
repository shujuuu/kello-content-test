title: Error Handling Techniques in GALHO90
---
This document will cover the error handling techniques used in the Kello Imagens project, which includes:

1. Error Logging
2. Error Reporting
3. Error Recovery.

# Error Logging

Error logging is a crucial part of error handling in the Kello Imagens project. It involves capturing error details and storing them in a log file or a logging system. This helps in diagnosing issues and understanding the context in which errors occur. Typically, error logging includes information such as the error message, stack trace, and the state of the application when the error occurred.

# Error Logging

The code snippet shows how errors are logged in the system. The `LOG-ERROR` procedure captures the error details and writes them to a log file. This helps in tracking and diagnosing issues.

# Error Reporting

Error reporting involves notifying the relevant stakeholders about the occurrence of an error. This can be done through various means such as email notifications, alerts, or dashboards. The goal is to ensure that the responsible team is aware of the issue and can take appropriate action to resolve it.

# Error Reporting

The code snippet demonstrates how errors are reported in the system. The `REPORT-ERROR` procedure sends an email notification to the support team with the error details. This ensures that the team is promptly informed about the issue.

# Error Recovery

Error recovery is the process of handling errors gracefully and ensuring that the system can continue to operate or fail safely. This involves implementing fallback mechanisms, retry logic, and user-friendly error messages. The goal is to minimize the impact of errors on the user experience and maintain system stability.

# Error Recovery

The code snippet illustrates how error recovery is implemented in the system. The `RECOVER-FROM-ERROR` procedure attempts to recover from the error by retrying the operation or switching to a fallback mechanism. This helps in maintaining system stability and providing a better user experience.
