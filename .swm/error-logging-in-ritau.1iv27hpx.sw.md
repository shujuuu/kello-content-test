# Purpose of the <SwmToken path="src/banks/ritau.cbl" pos="3:6:6" line-data="       PROGRAM-ID. RITAU.">`RITAU`</SwmToken> Program

The <SwmToken path="src/banks/ritau.cbl" pos="3:6:6" line-data="       PROGRAM-ID. RITAU.">`RITAU`</SwmToken> program is responsible for generating return reports from the ITAU bank. Depending on the type of occurrence, the system performs different actions such as recording the bank number, changing the file carrier, or lowering the title. If the title is not found during the update, the system generates a problem file for manual correction.

# Error Logging Mechanism

The variable <SwmToken path="src/banks/ritau.cbl" pos="74:3:7" line-data="       77  DISPLAY-ERROR-NO          PIC 9(4).">`DISPLAY-ERROR-NO`</SwmToken> is used for error logging. It is defined as a 4-digit numeric field and is part of the working storage section. This variable is likely used to capture and display error numbers during the execution of the program.

```cobol
           COPY "CBPRINT.CPY".
       78  REFRESH-TEXT-AND-DATA-PROC VALUE 255.
       77  DISPLAY-ERROR-NO          PIC 9(4).
       01  AREAS-DE-TRABALHO.
           05 ERRO-1              PIC XX     VALUE SPACES.
```

The <SwmPath>[src/copybook_files/LOGACESS.SEL](src/copybook_files/LOGACESS.SEL)</SwmPath> file is included in the program. This file is likely used for logging access and errors, although the exact details of its usage are not provided in the given context.
