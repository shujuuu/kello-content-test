This document will cover the methods used for error management in Customer Care, which includes:

1. Error Logging
2. Error Handling
3. User Notifications.

# Error Logging

Error logging is a crucial part of error management in Customer Care. It involves recording error details in a log file or a logging system. This helps in diagnosing issues and understanding the context in which errors occur. Typically, error logs include information such as the error message, timestamp, and the part of the system where the error occurred.

# Error Logging

The `LOG-ERROR` procedure is used to log errors. It captures the error message and other relevant details and writes them to a log file.

# Error Handling

Error handling involves defining how the system should respond when an error occurs. This can include retrying operations, rolling back transactions, or providing alternative solutions. Effective error handling ensures that the system remains stable and that users experience minimal disruption.

# Error Handling

The `HANDLE-ERROR` procedure is responsible for managing errors. It includes logic for retrying operations and rolling back transactions if necessary.

# User Notifications

User notifications are an important aspect of error management. When an error occurs, it is essential to inform the user in a clear and concise manner. This helps in managing user expectations and provides them with guidance on what to do next.

# User Notifications

The `NOTIFY-USER` procedure is used to notify users about errors. It generates user-friendly messages that explain the error and suggest possible actions.
