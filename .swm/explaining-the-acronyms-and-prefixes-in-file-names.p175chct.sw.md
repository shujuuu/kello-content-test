title: Explaining the acronyms and prefixes in file names
---
This document will cover the purpose and usage of the 'mtp' acronym in the Kello Imagens project. We'll cover:

1. What 'mtp' stands for
2. How 'mtp' is used in the codebase
3. Examples of 'mtp' in action

# What 'mtp' stands for

'mtp' is an acronym used in the Kello Imagens project to represent 'Movimento de Trabalho e ProduÃ§Ã£o' (Work and Production Movement). It is used as a prefix for various COBOL programs and modules related to managing work and production processes within the system.

# How 'mtp' is used in the codebase

The 'mtp' prefix is used in the naming of several COBOL source files and modules. These files typically contain programs that handle different aspects of work and production management. For example, <SwmPath>[src/mtp/mtp001.cbl](src/mtp/mtp001.cbl)</SwmPath> is a program for contract registration for assembly, and <SwmPath>[src/mtp/mtp002.cbl](src/mtp/mtp002.cbl)</SwmPath> is for stock location registration.

# How 'mtp' is used in the codebase

The file <SwmPath>[src/mtp/mtp001.cbl](src/mtp/mtp001.cbl)</SwmPath> is a COBOL program for contract registration for assembly. It includes the identification division and author information.

```cobol
       COPY DSLANG.CPY.
       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
       PROGRAM-ID. MTP001.
       AUTHOR. MARELI AMANCIO VOLPATO.
       DATE-WRITTEN. 21/06/2000
      *FUNÃ‡ÃƒO: Cadastro de Contratos P/ MONTAGEM
```

The file <SwmPath>[src/mtp/mtp002.cbl](src/mtp/mtp002.cbl)</SwmPath> is a COBOL program for stock location registration. It includes the identification division and author information.

```cobol
       COPY DSLANG.CPY.
       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
       PROGRAM-ID. MTP002.
      *AUTORA: MARELI AMANCIO VOLPATO

<SwmSnippet path="/src/mtp/mtp040.cbl" line="18">

---

The file <SwmPath>[src/mtp/mtp040.cbl](src/mtp/mtp040.cbl)</SwmPath> includes several COPY statements for importing other modules, including <SwmToken path="src/mtp/mtp040.cbl" pos="20:3:3" line-data="           COPY MTPX019.">`MTPX019`</SwmToken>, <SwmToken path="src/mtp/mtp040.cbl" pos="21:3:3" line-data="           COPY MTPX025.">`MTPX025`</SwmToken>, and <SwmToken path="src/mtp/mtp040.cbl" pos="22:3:3" line-data="           COPY MTPX030.">`MTPX030`</SwmToken>. These modules are part of the 'mtp' series and are used to manage different aspects of work and production.

```cobol
           COPY CAPX010.
           COPY IEPX011.
           COPY MTPX019.
           COPY MTPX025.
           COPY MTPX030.
```

# Examples of 'mtp' in action

Here are some examples of how 'mtp' is used in the codebase:

- In <SwmPath>[src/mtp/mtp001.cbl](src/mtp/mtp001.cbl)</SwmPath>, the program handles contract registration for assembly.
- In <SwmPath>[src/mtp/mtp002.cbl](src/mtp/mtp002.cbl)</SwmPath>, the program manages stock location registration.
- In <SwmPath>[src/mtp/mtp040.cbl](src/mtp/mtp040.cbl)</SwmPath>, various 'mtp' modules are imported using COPY statements to handle different aspects of work and production.
