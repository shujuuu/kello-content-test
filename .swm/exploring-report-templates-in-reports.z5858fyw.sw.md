title: Exploring Report Templates in Reports
---
Report Templates are predefined formats used to generate reports automatically.

They ensure consistency and standardization across different reports.

These templates define the structure, layout, and data fields to be included in the reports.

They are crucial for creating bank-specific EDI transactions and standard SBP payment slips.

The templates are stored in files such as <SwmPath>[app/last_known_compilation/compiler_control_files/REP100.LST](app/last_known_compilation/compiler_control_files/REP100.LST)</SwmPath>, <SwmPath>[app/last_known_compilation/compiler_control_files/REP101.LST](app/last_known_compilation/compiler_control_files/REP101.LST)</SwmPath>, and others within the <SwmPath>[src/kello/](src/kello/)</SwmPath> directory.
