title: Generation and usage of reports in the Kello system
---
This document will cover how various reports (rep201.cpb, <SwmPath>[tests/BUILD/rep203.cbl](tests/BUILD/rep203.cbl)</SwmPath>, etc.) are generated and used in the system. We'll cover:

1. Overview of report generation
2. Detailed explanation of specific reports
3. How reports are used in the system.

# Overview of report generation

The system generates various reports using COBOL programs. Each report program is responsible for extracting data, processing it, and formatting it into a report. The reports are generated based on specific criteria and intervals defined within the programs.

# Detailed explanation of specific reports

The report <SwmPath>[tests/BUILD/rep201.cbl](tests/BUILD/rep201.cbl)</SwmPath> is designed to list all reports within a specified interval. It uses various COPY statements to include necessary data definitions and procedures.

```cobol
       COPY DSLANG.CPY.
       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
       PROGRAM-ID. REP201.
      *DATA: 14/04/2000
      *AUTORA: MARELI AM√ÇNCIO VOLPATO
      *FUN√á√ÉO: Extrato de REPORTAGEM
      *        Listar todos as reportagens que estiverem
      *        dentro do intervalo de reportagem solicitado.
       ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.
       SPECIAL-NAMES.
         DECIMAL-POINT IS COMMA
         PRINTER IS LPRINTER.
       class-control.
```

# How reports are used in the system

Once generated, the reports are used for various business operations. They provide insights into reporting activities, team performance, and expenses. The reports can be printed or exported to different formats like Excel for further analysis.
