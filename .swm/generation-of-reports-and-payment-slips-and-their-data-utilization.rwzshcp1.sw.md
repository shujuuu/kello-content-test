title: Generation of reports and payment slips and their data utilization
---
This document will cover the process of generating reports and payment slips in the Kello Imagens system, which includes:

1. The process of generating reports
2. The process of generating payment slips
3. The specific data utilized in these processes.

# The process of generating reports

In the Kello Imagens system, reports are generated automatically based on the data stored in the CRM. The system uses COBOL-85 to compile and execute the report generation logic. The reports typically include data such as customer information, transaction history, and other relevant business metrics.

# The process of generating reports

The `generate_report` function is responsible for compiling the necessary data and formatting it into a report. This function pulls data from various tables in the database and organizes it into a readable format.

# The process of generating payment slips

Payment slips in the Kello Imagens system are generated using standard SBP (Sistema de Boletos de Pagamento) formats. The system ensures that each payment slip includes all necessary details such as the payer's information, the amount due, and the due date. This process is also handled by COBOL-85 programs that compile and format the data accordingly.

# The process of generating payment slips

The `generate_payment_slip` function is responsible for creating payment slips. It gathers data from the CRM, formats it according to SBP standards, and outputs the final payment slip.

# The specific data utilized in these processes

Both report and payment slip generation processes utilize specific data from the CRM system. This includes customer details, transaction records, payment histories, and other relevant business data. The data is pulled from various tables in the database and processed by COBOL-85 programs to generate the final output.

# The specific data utilized in these processes

The `fetch_data` function is used to retrieve the necessary data from the database. This function is called by both the report and payment slip generation processes to ensure they have the required information.
