title: Getting started with Report Listings in Reports
---
Report Listings are files that contain the output of various reports generated by the system.

These listings are used to present data in a structured format, making it easier for users to review and analyze the information.

Each report listing file, such as <SwmPath>[app/last_known_compilation/compiler_control_files/REP100.LST](app/last_known_compilation/compiler_control_files/REP100.LST)</SwmPath> or <SwmPath>[app/last_known_compilation/compiler_control_files/REP500.LST](app/last_known_compilation/compiler_control_files/REP500.LST)</SwmPath>, corresponds to a specific type of report.

The files are stored in the <SwmPath>[src/kello/](src/kello/)</SwmPath> directory and are named according to the report they represent.

The listings include details such as transaction records, financial summaries, and other business-related data.
