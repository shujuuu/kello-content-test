title: Handling Bank-Specific EDI Transactions in COBOL
---
This document will cover how the COBOL program handles bank-specific EDI transactions. We'll cover:

1. Overview of EDI transactions
2. Key COBOL programs involved
3. Data flow and processing steps.

# Overview of EDI transactions

Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transactions are used to exchange business documents between systems in a standardized electronic format. In the context of the Kello Imagens system, EDI transactions are used for bank-specific operations such as payment processing and report generation.

# Key COBOL programs involved

The COBOL programs responsible for handling bank-specific EDI transactions are located in the <SwmPath>[src/banks/](src/banks/)</SwmPath> directory. These programs include <SwmPath>[src/banks/caixa.cbl](src/banks/caixa.cbl)</SwmPath>, <SwmPath>[src/banks/itau.cbl](src/banks/itau.cbl)</SwmPath>, <SwmPath>[src/banks/hsbc.cbl](src/banks/hsbc.cbl)</SwmPath>, and others. Each of these programs is tailored to handle the specific requirements of different banks.

# Key COBOL programs involved

The <SwmPath>[src/banks/caixa.cbl](src/banks/caixa.cbl)</SwmPath> program handles EDI transactions for Caixa bank. It includes sections for initializing the program, processing transactions, and generating reports.

```cobol
       copy dslang.cpy.

The <SwmPath>[src/banks/itau.cbl](src/banks/itau.cbl)</SwmPath> program handles EDI transactions for Itau bank. Similar to <SwmPath>[src/banks/caixa.cbl](src/banks/caixa.cbl)</SwmPath>, it includes sections for initialization, transaction processing, and report generation.

```cobol
       copy dslang.cpy.
       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.

# Data flow and processing steps

The data flow for handling EDI transactions typically involves the following steps:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes by setting up necessary variables and reading input parameters.
2. **Transaction Processing**: The program processes each transaction by reading data from input files, performing necessary computations, and updating records.
3. **Report Generation**: After processing transactions, the program generates reports and writes output files.
