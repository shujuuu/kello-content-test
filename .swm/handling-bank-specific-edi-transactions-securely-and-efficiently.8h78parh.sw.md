# Initialization of the program

The <SwmToken path="src/oep/oep030.cbl" pos="266:1:3" line-data="       INICIALIZA-PROGRAMA SECTION.">`INICIALIZA-PROGRAMA`</SwmToken> section initializes the program by accepting parameters from the command line and setting up various data blocks and control blocks. This ensures that the program starts with a clean and controlled environment.

```cobol
       INICIALIZA-PROGRAMA SECTION.
           ACCEPT PARAMETROS-W FROM COMMAND-LINE.
           COPY "CBDATA1.CPY".
           MOVE HORA-REL TO HORA-RELA
           MOVE EMISSAO-REL TO EMISSAO-RELA.
           MOVE DATA-INV TO DATA-MOVTO-W DATA-MOVTO-REL.
           CALL "GRIDAT2"  USING DATA-INV.
           MOVE DATA-INV       TO DATA-DIA-I.
           MOVE ZEROS TO PAG-W ERRO-W.
           INITIALIZE GS-DATA-BLOCK
           INITIALIZE DS-CONTROL-BLOCK
           MOVE GS-DATA-BLOCK-VERSION-NO
                                   TO DS-DATA-BLOCK-VERSION-NO
           MOVE GS-VERSION-NO  TO DS-VERSION-NO
           MOVE EMPRESA-W          TO EMP-REC
           MOVE NOME-EMPRESA-W     TO EMPRESA-REL
           MOVE "CGD001" TO ARQ-REC.  MOVE EMPRESA-REF TO PATH-CGD001.
           MOVE "CGD010" TO ARQ-REC.  MOVE EMPRESA-REF TO PATH-CGD010.
           MOVE "CGD020" TO ARQ-REC.  MOVE EMPRESA-REF TO PATH-CGD020.
           MOVE "CXD020" TO ARQ-REC.  MOVE EMPRESA-REF TO PATH-CXD020.
           MOVE "CAD018" TO ARQ-REC.  MOVE EMPRESA-REF TO PATH-CAD018.
