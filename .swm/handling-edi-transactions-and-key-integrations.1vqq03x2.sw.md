# Overview of EDI transactions

Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) is a method for exchanging business documents between organizations in a standardized electronic format. In the context of Kello Imagens, EDI transactions are used for bank-specific transactions and payment slip generation.

# Key integrations for EDI transactions

The key integrations for handling EDI transactions in Kello Imagens include:

- **Bank Systems**: Integration with various bank systems to facilitate EDI transactions.
- **SBP Payment Slip Generation**: Integration for generating standard SBP payment slips.
- **Automatic Report Generation**: Integration for generating reports based on EDI transactions.

# Example of EDI transaction handling in the code

The `process_edi_transaction` function is responsible for handling EDI transactions. It reads the EDI file, processes the data, and integrates with the bank systems to complete the transaction.
