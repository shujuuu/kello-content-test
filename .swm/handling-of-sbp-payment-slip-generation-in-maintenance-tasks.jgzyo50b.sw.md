3. Data flow and processing steps

# Overview of SBP payment slip generation

SBP payment slip generation is a crucial feature in the Kello Imagens system. It automates the creation of payment slips according to the SBP (Sistema de Boletos de Pagamento) standard, which is widely used in Brazil for billing and payment processing.

# Key components involved

The generation of SBP payment slips involves several key components:

- **COBOL Programs**: These handle the core logic for generating the payment slips.
- **Configuration Files**: These files contain settings and parameters required for the generation process.
- **Database**: Stores the necessary data such as customer information, billing details, and transaction records.

# Data flow and processing steps

The data flow and processing steps for generating SBP payment slips are as follows:

# Data flow and processing steps

The COBOL program `generate_sbp_slips.cbl` is responsible for initiating the payment slip generation process. It reads the necessary data from the database and applies the business logic to format the slips according to SBP standards.

The program then writes the formatted payment slips to an output file, which can be printed or sent electronically to the customers.

The configuration file `sbp_config.cfg` contains parameters such as bank codes, branch numbers, and other settings required for generating the payment slips.
