1. Overview of SBP standards
2. Data requirements for SBP compliance
3. Implementation details
4. Example usage

# Overview of SBP standards

SBP (Standard Bank Payment) standards are a set of guidelines that ensure payment slips are formatted and processed correctly by banks. These standards include specific requirements for data fields, layout, and encoding to facilitate automated processing.

# Data requirements for SBP compliance

To comply with SBP standards, the payment slip must include specific data fields such as payer information, payee information, payment amount, due date, and a unique identifier. Additionally, the data must be encoded in a format that is readable by bank systems.

# Implementation details

The implementation of automated payment slip generation involves several steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather all necessary information from the user or system.
2. **Data Validation**: Ensure that all required fields are present and correctly formatted.
3. **Slip Generation**: Create the payment slip using the collected data, ensuring it adheres to SBP standards.
4. **Encoding**: Encode the payment slip in the required format for bank processing.
5. **Output**: Generate the final payment slip document, which can be printed or sent electronically.

# Implementation details

The `generate_payment_slip` function is responsible for creating the payment slip. It collects data, validates it, and formats it according to SBP standards.

# Example usage

To generate a payment slip, you would call the `generate_payment_slip` function with the necessary data. For example:

```
CALL 'generate_payment_slip' USING payer_data, payee_data, amount, due_date, unique_id.
```

This will produce a payment slip that complies with SBP standards, ready for printing or electronic transmission.
