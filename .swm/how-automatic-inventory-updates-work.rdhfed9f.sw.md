title: How automatic inventory updates work
---
This document will cover the process of automatically updating inventory records based on transactions. We'll cover:

1. How transactions are processed
2. How inventory records are updated
3. Examples and use cases

# How transactions are processed

Transactions in the Kello Imagens system are processed through a series of COBOL programs that handle various business operations. Each transaction, whether it's a sale, return, or adjustment, triggers specific routines that update the system's records.

# How transactions are processed

The `PROCESS-TRANSACTION` section in `transactions.cbl` handles the initial processing of a transaction. It validates the transaction details and prepares the data for further processing.

# How inventory records are updated

Once a transaction is processed, the system updates the inventory records to reflect the changes. This involves adjusting the quantities of items in stock, updating the status of inventory items, and recording the transaction details for future reference.

# How inventory records are updated

The `UPDATE-INVENTORY` section in `inventory-update.cbl` is responsible for adjusting the inventory records. It takes the transaction data and updates the relevant inventory items accordingly.

# Examples and use cases

For example, when a sale transaction is processed, the system decreases the quantity of the sold items in the inventory. If a return transaction is processed, the system increases the quantity of the returned items. These updates ensure that the inventory records are always accurate and up-to-date.
