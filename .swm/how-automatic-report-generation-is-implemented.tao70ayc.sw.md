# Overview of automatic report generation

Automatic report generation in Kello Imagens is designed to streamline the creation of business reports without manual intervention. This feature is crucial for generating timely and accurate reports based on the data processed by the system.

# Key components involved

The implementation involves several key components:

- **Report Templates**: Predefined templates that dictate the structure and content of the reports.
- **Data Sources**: The databases and data files from which the report data is extracted.
- **Report Generator**: The core module that processes the data and populates the templates to create the final reports.

# Data flow and process

The data flow for automatic report generation typically follows these steps:

1. **Data Extraction**: The system extracts relevant data from the data sources.
2. **Template Selection**: Based on the type of report, the appropriate template is selected.
3. **Data Processing**: The extracted data is processed and formatted according to the template requirements.
4. **Report Generation**: The processed data is populated into the template to generate the final report.
5. **Report Distribution**: The generated report is then distributed to the relevant stakeholders or stored in the system for future reference.

# Data flow and process

The `generate_report` function is responsible for orchestrating the report generation process. It handles data extraction, template selection, data processing, and final report creation.

# Example use cases

Some common use cases for automatic report generation in Kello Imagens include:

- **Monthly Sales Reports**: Automatically generated at the end of each month to provide insights into sales performance.
- **Inventory Reports**: Generated periodically to track inventory levels and movements.
- **Financial Statements**: Created at regular intervals to summarize the financial status of the business.
