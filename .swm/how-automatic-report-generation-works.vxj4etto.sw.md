# Overview of automatic report generation

Automatic report generation in Kello Imagens is a feature designed to streamline the creation of business reports. This functionality allows users to generate reports without manual intervention, ensuring consistency, accuracy, and efficiency in report creation.

# Key components involved

The automatic report generation system involves several key components:

- **Report Templates**: Predefined templates that dictate the structure and content of the reports.
- **Data Sources**: Various data sources from which the necessary information is pulled to populate the reports.
- **Report Generator**: The core engine that processes the templates and data to produce the final reports.

# Data flow and processing

The data flow for automatic report generation typically follows these steps:

1. **Template Selection**: The system selects the appropriate report template based on the type of report being generated.
2. **Data Extraction**: Relevant data is extracted from the specified data sources.
3. **Data Processing**: The extracted data is processed and formatted according to the rules defined in the report template.
4. **Report Generation**: The processed data is merged with the template to create the final report, which is then saved or distributed as needed.

# Data flow and processing

The `report_generator` module is responsible for the core logic of report generation. It takes the selected template and data, processes them, and produces the final report.

# Example use cases

Here are some example use cases for automatic report generation:

- **Monthly Sales Reports**: Automatically generate detailed sales reports at the end of each month.
- **Financial Statements**: Produce quarterly financial statements for review by stakeholders.
- **Operational Metrics**: Create daily or weekly reports on key operational metrics to monitor business performance.
