# Setting up the environment and file control

The program <SwmToken path="src/alt/altseqbr.CBL" pos="3:6:6" line-data="       PROGRAM-ID. ALTSEQBR.">`ALTSEQBR`</SwmToken> is defined with the necessary environment settings and file control configurations. The file <SwmToken path="src/alt/altseqbr.CBL" pos="15:3:3" line-data="           SELECT SEQBRAS ASSIGN TO PATH-SEQBRA">`SEQBRAS`</SwmToken> is assigned to <SwmToken path="src/alt/altseqbr.CBL" pos="15:9:11" line-data="           SELECT SEQBRAS ASSIGN TO PATH-SEQBRA">`PATH-SEQBRA`</SwmToken> with indexed organization and dynamic access mode.

Similarly, the program <SwmToken path="src/kello/altseqbr.CBL" pos="3:6:6" line-data="       PROGRAM-ID. ALTSEQBR.">`ALTSEQBR`</SwmToken> in this file also sets up the environment and file control for processing bank-specific EDI transactions.

# Defining the data structure

The data structure for the file <SwmToken path="src/alt/altseqbr.CBL" pos="25:3:3" line-data="       FD  SEQBRAS.">`SEQBRAS`</SwmToken> is defined in the <SwmToken path="src/alt/altseqbr.CBL" pos="22:1:3" line-data="       DATA DIVISION.">`DATA DIVISION`</SwmToken>. The record <SwmToken path="src/alt/altseqbr.CBL" pos="26:3:5" line-data="       01  REG-SEQBRAS.">`REG-SEQBRAS`</SwmToken> contains fields <SwmToken path="src/alt/altseqbr.CBL" pos="27:3:5" line-data="           05  CONT-SEQUENCIA  PIC 9.">`CONT-SEQUENCIA`</SwmToken> and <SwmToken path="src/alt/altseqbr.CBL" pos="27:5:5" line-data="           05  CONT-SEQUENCIA  PIC 9.">`SEQUENCIA`</SwmToken>.

```cobol


       DATA DIVISION.
       FILE SECTION.

       FD  SEQBRAS.
       01  REG-SEQBRAS.
           05  CONT-SEQUENCIA  PIC 9.
           05  SEQUENCIA       PIC 9(10).
```

The same data structure is defined in this file, ensuring consistency in the processing of bank-specific EDI transactions.

```cobol


       DATA DIVISION.
       FILE SECTION.

       FD  SEQBRAS.
       01  REG-SEQBRAS.
           05  CONT-SEQUENCIA  PIC 9.
           05  SEQUENCIA       PIC 9(10).

# Executing the transaction processing

The <SwmToken path="src/alt/altseqbr.CBL" pos="31:1:3" line-data="       WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.">`WORKING-STORAGE`</SwmToken> section includes copies of necessary control files. The transaction processing is initiated by moving control settings and performing the <SwmToken path="src/alt/altseqbr.CBL" pos="126:3:7" line-data="           PERFORM CALL-DIALOG-SYSTEM.">`CALL-DIALOG-SYSTEM`</SwmToken>.

```cobol
       WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
           COPY "ALTSEQBR.CPB".
           COPY "ALTSEQBR.CPY".
           COPY "DS-CNTRL.MF".
```

</SwmSnippet>

<SwmSnippet path="/src/kello/altseqbr.CBL" line="31">

The same steps are followed in this file to execute the transaction processing, ensuring that the system behaves consistently across different modules.

```cobol
       WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
           COPY "ALTSEQBR.CPB".
           COPY "ALTSEQBR.CPY".
           COPY "DS-CNTRL.MF".
```
