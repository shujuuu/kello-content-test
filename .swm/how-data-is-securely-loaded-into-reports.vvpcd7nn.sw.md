This document will cover how data is securely loaded into reports, which includes:

1. Data Definitions
2. Data Loading Process
3. Security Measures

# Data Definitions

The <SwmToken path="src/cop/cop007e.cbl" pos="27:1:3" line-data="       DATA DIVISION.">`DATA DIVISION`</SwmToken> in COBOL is where all the data items used in the program are defined. This section includes definitions for various data items that will be used in the report generation process.

```cobol
       DATA DIVISION.
       FILE SECTION.
```

<SwmSnippet path="/src/cop/cop007e.cbl" line="126">

---

The variable <SwmToken path="src/cop/cop007e.cbl" pos="126:3:3" line-data="           05  DATAW.">`DATAW`</SwmToken> is defined here, which includes day and month components. This variable is used to store date-related information that will be included in the reports.

```cobol
           05  DATAW.
               10  DIA-W       PIC 99.
               10  MES-W       PIC 99.
```

<SwmSnippet path="/src/cop/cop007e.cbl" line="196">

---

The variable <SwmToken path="src/cop/cop007e.cbl" pos="196:3:3" line-data="           05  DATAWI.">`DATAWI`</SwmToken> is another date-related variable that includes month and year components. This is also used in the report generation process.

```cobol
           05  DATAWI.
               10  MESANO-WI   PIC 999999.
               10  DIA-WI      PIC 99.
```

# Data Loading Process

The <SwmToken path="src/logacess.cbl" pos="48:1:3" line-data="       DATA DIVISION.">`DATA DIVISION`</SwmToken> in this file includes a copy statement for <SwmPath>[src/copybook_files/LOGACESS.FD](src/copybook_files/LOGACESS.FD)</SwmPath>, which defines the file structure for logging access. This is part of the data loading process for generating reports.

```cobol
       DATA DIVISION.
       FILE SECTION.
       COPY LOGACESS.FD.
```

</SwmSnippet>

<SwmSnippet path="/src/logacess.cbl" line="56">

---

The variable <SwmToken path="src/logacess.cbl" pos="56:3:5" line-data="               10 DATA-WK.">`DATA-WK`</SwmToken> is defined here, which includes year and month components. This variable is used to store date-related information that will be included in the reports.

```cobol
               10 DATA-WK.
                  15 ANO-WK          PIC 9(04).
                  15 MES-WK          PIC 9(02).
```

<SwmSnippet path="/src/rep/rep204.cbl" line="59">

---

The variable <SwmToken path="src/rep/rep204.cbl" pos="59:3:7" line-data="           05  DATA-REPORT-WK      PIC 9(8).">`DATA-REPORT-WK`</SwmToken> is defined here, which includes date-related information for the report. This variable is crucial for loading data into the reports.

```cobol
           05  DATA-REPORT-WK      PIC 9(8).
           05  DATA-VENDA-WK       PIC 9(8).
           05  FORMANDO-WK         PIC 9(4).
```

# Security Measures

The <SwmPath>[data/config/](data/config/)</SwmPath> directory contains configuration files that include security settings for data access and report generation. These settings ensure that only authorized users can access and load data into reports.

# Security Measures

The <SwmPath>[data/messages/](data/messages/)</SwmPath> directory contains messages related to data loading and security. These messages are used to inform users about the status of data loading and any security issues that may arise.
