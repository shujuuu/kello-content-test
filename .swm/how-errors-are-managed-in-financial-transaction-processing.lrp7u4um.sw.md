title: How errors are managed in financial transaction processing
---
This document will cover how errors are managed in financial transaction processing, which includes:

1. Error Detection
2. Error Logging
3. Error Handling and Recovery.

# Error Detection

Error detection in financial transaction processing involves identifying anomalies or issues during the transaction process. This can include validation checks, such as ensuring all required fields are filled, data types are correct, and values are within acceptable ranges. Detection mechanisms are typically embedded within the transaction processing logic to catch errors as early as possible.

# Error Logging

Once an error is detected, it is crucial to log the error for auditing and debugging purposes. Error logs should capture detailed information about the error, including the type of error, the transaction details, the timestamp, and any relevant system state information. This helps in diagnosing the issue and understanding the context in which the error occurred.

# Error Logging

In the `transaction_processor.cbl` file, errors are logged using the `LOG-ERROR` procedure. This procedure captures the error details and writes them to a log file for further analysis.

# Error Handling and Recovery

After logging the error, the system must handle the error appropriately to ensure the integrity of the financial transactions. Error handling strategies can include retry mechanisms, rolling back transactions, or alerting the user or system administrator. The goal is to recover from the error gracefully without causing data corruption or loss.

# Error Handling and Recovery

The `HANDLE-ERROR` procedure in the `transaction_processor.cbl` file demonstrates how the system handles errors. It includes logic for retrying the transaction and rolling back changes if necessary.
