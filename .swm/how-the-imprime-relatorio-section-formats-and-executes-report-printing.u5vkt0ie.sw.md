title: How the IMPRIME-RELATORIO section formats and executes report printing
---
This document will cover how the <SwmToken path="src/oep/oep053.cbl" pos="835:1:3" line-data="       IMPRIME-RELATORIO SECTION.">`IMPRIME-RELATORIO`</SwmToken> section formats and executes report printing. We'll cover:

1. Initializing the report
2. Ordering the data
3. Generating the header
4. Moving data to the report
5. Finalizing the report

# Initializing the report

The <SwmToken path="src/oep/oep053.cbl" pos="835:1:3" line-data="       IMPRIME-RELATORIO SECTION.">`IMPRIME-RELATORIO`</SwmToken> section starts by initializing the page counter <SwmToken path="src/oep/oep053.cbl" pos="836:7:9" line-data="           MOVE ZEROS TO PAG-W.">`PAG-W`</SwmToken> to zero.

```cobol
      *-------------------------------------------------------
       IMPRIME-RELATORIO SECTION.
           MOVE ZEROS TO PAG-W.

```

It then includes a copy of the CONDENSA section and initializes the  `REG-WORK` area.&nbsp;

```cobol
           COPY CONDENSA.

           INITIALIZE REGION-WORK
```

# Ordering the data

The ORDEM section is performed to order the data based on the value of <SwmToken path="src/oep/oep053.cbl" pos="651:3:5" line-data="           EVALUATE GS-ORDEM">`GS-ORDEM`</SwmToken>.

```cobol
           PERFORM ORDEM
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

<SwmSnippet path="/src/oep/oep053.cbl" line="650">

---

The ORDEM section evaluates <SwmToken path="src/oep/oep053.cbl" pos="651:3:5" line-data="           EVALUATE GS-ORDEM">`GS-ORDEM`</SwmToken> and sets the appropriate order key and description.

```cobol
       ORDEM SECTION.
           EVALUATE GS-ORDEM
             WHEN 1
                MOVE "CONTRATO" TO GS-DESCR-ORDEM
                START WORK KEY IS NOT < CONTRATO-WK INVALID KEY
                      MOVE "10" TO ST-WORK
             WHEN 2
                MOVE "CIDADE" TO GS-DESCR-ORDEM
                START WORK KEY IS NOT < CIDADE-WK INVALID KEY
                      MOVE "10" TO ST-WORK
             WHEN 3
                MOVE "PADRÃO" TO GS-DESCR-ORDEM
                START WORK KEY IS NOT < PADRAO-WK INVALID KEY
                      MOVE "10" TO ST-WORK
             WHEN 4
                MOVE "MES/ANO" TO GS-DESCR-ORDEM
                START WORK KEY IS NOT < MESANO-WK INVALID KEY
                      MOVE "10" TO ST-WORK
             WHEN 5
                MOVE "REPRESENT" TO GS-DESCR-ORDEM
                START WORK KEY IS NOT < REPRESENT-WK INVALID KEY

# Generating the header

The CABECALHO section is performed to generate the report header.

```cobol
           PERFORM CABECALHO
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

<SwmSnippet path="/src/oep/oep053.cbl" line="992">

The CABECALHO section moves the order description to <SwmToken path="src/oep/oep053.cbl" pos="993:11:13" line-data="           MOVE GS-DESCR-ORDEM TO ORDEM-REL.">`ORDEM-REL`</SwmToken>, increments the line counter, and writes the header lines to the report.

```cobol
       CABECALHO SECTION.
           MOVE GS-DESCR-ORDEM TO ORDEM-REL.
           ADD 1 TO LIN PAG-W.
           MOVE PAG-W TO PG-REL.
           IF LIN = 1
              WRITE REG-RELAT FROM CAB01
           ELSE WRITE REG-RELAT FROM CAB01 AFTER PAGE.
           WRITE REG-RELAT FROM CAB02 AFTER 2.
           WRITE REG-RELAT FROM CAB03.
           WRITE REG-RELAT FROM CAB04.
           WRITE REG-RELAT FROM CAB03.
           MOVE 6 TO LIN.

# Moving data to the report

The section then moves spaces to <SwmToken path="src/oep/oep053.cbl" pos="844:7:9" line-data="           MOVE SPACES TO LINDET-REL">`LINDET-REL`</SwmToken> and performs a loop until <SwmToken path="src/oep/oep053.cbl" pos="845:5:7" line-data="           PERFORM UNTIL ST-WORK = &quot;10&quot;">`ST-WORK`</SwmToken> equals '10'. Within the loop, it reads the next record from WORK and performs <SwmToken path="src/oep/oep053.cbl" pos="849:3:7" line-data="                   PERFORM MOVER-DADOS-RELATORIO">`MOVER-DADOS-RELATORIO`</SwmToken> if not at the end.

```cobol
