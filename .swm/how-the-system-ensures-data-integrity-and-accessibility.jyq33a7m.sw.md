title: How the system ensures data integrity and accessibility
---
This document will cover how the system ensures data integrity and accessibility for customer-related information. We'll cover:

1. Data Integrity Mechanisms
2. Data Accessibility Features

# Data Integrity Mechanisms

Data integrity is crucial for maintaining accurate and reliable customer-related information. The system employs several mechanisms to ensure data integrity:

- **Validation Rules**: Before data is entered into the system, it undergoes a series of validation checks to ensure it meets predefined criteria. This includes format checks, range checks, and consistency checks.
- **Transaction Management**: The system uses transaction management to ensure that all database operations are completed successfully before committing the data. If any operation fails, the transaction is rolled back to maintain data consistency.
- **Audit Trails**: Every change to customer-related information is logged with details about the change, including who made the change and when it was made. This helps in tracking and reverting any erroneous changes.
- **Referential Integrity**: The system enforces referential integrity by using foreign key constraints to ensure that relationships between tables remain consistent.

# Data Accessibility Features

Ensuring that customer-related information is easily accessible to authorized users is another critical aspect of the system. The following features are implemented to achieve this:

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: The system uses RBAC to control access to customer-related information. Users are assigned roles, and each role has specific permissions that determine what data can be accessed and what actions can be performed.
- **Search and Filtering**: The system provides robust search and filtering capabilities, allowing users to quickly find the customer information they need. This includes full-text search, advanced filtering options, and sorting capabilities.
- **Data Replication**: To ensure high availability and quick access, customer-related information is replicated across multiple servers. This reduces latency and ensures that data is available even if one server goes down.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Regular backups are taken to ensure that customer-related information can be restored in case of data loss. The system also has a recovery mechanism to quickly restore data from backups.
