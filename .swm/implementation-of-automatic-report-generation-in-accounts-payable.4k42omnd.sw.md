# Overview of automatic report generation

Automatic report generation in Kello Imagens is designed to streamline the creation of business reports without manual intervention. This feature is crucial for generating timely and accurate reports based on the data processed by the system.

# Key components involved

The implementation involves several key components:

- **COBOL Programs**: Core logic for report generation is written in COBOL-85.
- **Configuration Files**: Define the parameters and templates for the reports.
- **Database**: Stores the data that will be used in the reports.
- **Scheduler**: Triggers the report generation process at specified intervals.

# Data flow and process

The data flow for automatic report generation can be summarized as follows:

1. **Data Collection**: Data is collected from various sources and stored in the database.
2. **Triggering the Process**: The scheduler triggers the report generation process based on predefined intervals or events.
3. **Report Generation**: COBOL programs process the data and generate the reports using the templates defined in the configuration files.
4. **Output**: The generated reports are saved in a specified directory or sent to designated recipients via email.

# Example usage

To implement automatic report generation, follow these steps:

1. **Configure the Scheduler**: Set up the scheduler to trigger the report generation process at the desired intervals.
2. **Define Report Templates**: Create and configure the report templates in the configuration files.
3. **Implement COBOL Programs**: Write the COBOL programs that will process the data and generate the reports.
4. **Deploy and Monitor**: Deploy the system and monitor the report generation process to ensure it runs smoothly.
