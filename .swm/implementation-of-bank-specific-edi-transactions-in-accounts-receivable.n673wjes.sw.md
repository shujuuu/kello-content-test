1. Overview of EDI transactions
2. How EDI transactions are implemented in the Accounts Receivable system
3. Example of EDI transaction implementation

# Overview of EDI transactions

Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transactions are standardized electronic formats for exchanging business information between organizations. In the context of the Accounts Receivable system, EDI transactions are used to automate the exchange of financial documents, such as invoices and payment instructions, with banks.

# How EDI transactions are implemented in the Accounts Receivable system

In the Accounts Receivable system, bank-specific EDI transactions are implemented to facilitate seamless communication with various banks. The system generates EDI files that conform to the specific requirements of each bank. These files are then transmitted to the banks for processing.

# How EDI transactions are implemented in the Accounts Receivable system

The `generate_edi_file` function is responsible for creating the EDI file. It takes the necessary financial data and formats it according to the bank's specifications.

The `transmit_edi_file` function handles the transmission of the generated EDI file to the bank. This function ensures that the file is sent securely and confirms receipt by the bank.

# Example of EDI transaction implementation

Consider a scenario where the Accounts Receivable system needs to send an invoice to a bank. The `generate_edi_file` function will format the invoice data into the bank's required EDI format. Once the file is generated, the `transmit_edi_file` function will send the file to the bank. The bank processes the file and sends back a confirmation, which is then recorded in the system.
