title: Implementation of bank-specific EDI transactions in maintenance programs
---
This document will cover the implementation of bank-specific EDI transactions in the maintenance programs, which includes:

1. Overview of EDI transactions
2. How EDI transactions are integrated into maintenance programs
3. Example of EDI transaction implementation

# Overview of EDI transactions

Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) is a standardized method for exchanging business information between systems. In the context of Kello Imagens, EDI transactions are used to facilitate communication with banks for various financial operations.

# How EDI transactions are integrated into maintenance programs

In Kello Imagens, maintenance programs are responsible for ensuring that the system's data and operations remain consistent and up-to-date. Bank-specific EDI transactions are integrated into these programs to automate the exchange of financial data with banks. This integration involves setting up specific COBOL routines that handle the creation, transmission, and processing of EDI messages.

# Example of EDI transaction implementation

The following COBOL code snippet demonstrates how an EDI transaction is implemented in a maintenance program. The code sets up the necessary data structures, formats the EDI message, and sends it to the bank's EDI system.
