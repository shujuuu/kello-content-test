title: Implementation of CRUD Operations in Branch-Related COBOL Programs
---
This document will cover how CRUD operations are implemented in branch-related COBOL programs. We'll cover:

1. Overview of CRUD operations in COBOL
2. Detailed implementation in the <SwmPath>[src/kello/crp055.cbl](src/kello/crp055.cbl)</SwmPath> file
3. Key sections and functions involved

# Overview of CRUD operations in COBOL

CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are fundamental in managing data in any application. In COBOL, these operations are typically implemented using file handling and database access routines. The operations are performed through various sections and paragraphs within the COBOL program, often controlled by flags and conditions.

# Detailed implementation in the <SwmPath>[src/kello/crp055.cbl](src/kello/crp055.cbl)</SwmPath> file

The <SwmToken path="src/kello/crp055.cbl" pos="296:1:3" line-data="       CORPO-PROGRAMA SECTION.">`CORPO-PROGRAMA`</SwmToken> section in the <SwmPath>[src/kello/crp055.cbl](src/kello/crp055.cbl)</SwmPath> file is where the main logic for CRUD operations is implemented.
