title: Implementation of EDI Transaction Handling
---
This document will cover the implementation of EDI transaction handling, including error handling and data validation. We'll cover:

1. EDI transaction handling
2. Error handling
3. Data validation.

# EDI transaction handling

EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) transaction handling in Kello Imagens involves the processing of electronic transactions between businesses. This is crucial for automating business processes and ensuring efficient communication between different systems. The implementation involves reading EDI files, parsing the data, and processing the transactions according to predefined business rules.

# EDI transaction handling

The `EDI-HANDLER` section is responsible for reading and parsing EDI files. It ensures that the data is correctly interpreted and ready for further processing.

# Error handling

Error handling in EDI transaction processing is critical to ensure that any issues encountered during the processing are properly managed. This includes logging errors, notifying relevant stakeholders, and retrying failed transactions if necessary.

# Error handling

The `ERROR-HANDLING` section captures any errors that occur during the EDI transaction processing. It logs the errors and takes appropriate actions such as retrying the transaction or notifying the user.

# Data validation

Data validation ensures that the data received in the EDI transactions is accurate and conforms to the expected format. This step is crucial to prevent processing errors and ensure data integrity.

# Data validation

The `DATA-VALIDATION` section checks the integrity and format of the data in the EDI transactions. It ensures that all required fields are present and correctly formatted before processing the transaction.
