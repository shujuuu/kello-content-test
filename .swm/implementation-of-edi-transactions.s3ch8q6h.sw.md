title: Implementation of EDI transactions
---
This document will cover the implementation of EDI transactions in the Kello Imagens system, which includes:

1. Overview of EDI transactions
2. EDI transaction generation
3. EDI transaction processing.

# Overview of EDI transactions

Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transactions are used in Kello Imagens to facilitate automated communication with banks and other financial institutions. These transactions follow specific formats and standards to ensure compatibility and accuracy.

# EDI transaction generation

The `edi_generator.cbl` file contains the logic for generating EDI transactions. This involves creating the necessary data structures, populating them with relevant information, and formatting the data according to EDI standards.

The function `generate_edi_transaction` is responsible for assembling the EDI transaction. It takes input data, processes it, and outputs a correctly formatted EDI file ready for transmission.

# EDI transaction processing

The `edi_processor.cbl` file handles the processing of incoming EDI transactions. This includes parsing the received data, validating it against expected formats, and updating the system's records accordingly.

The function `process_edi_transaction` is responsible for interpreting the EDI data and performing the necessary actions within the system. This may involve updating customer records, processing payments, or generating reports.
