# Overview of automatic report generation

Automatic report generation in Kello Imagens is a feature designed to streamline the creation of business reports without manual intervention. This functionality is crucial for generating timely and accurate reports that are essential for business operations and decision-making.

# Key components involved

The main components involved in automatic report generation include:

- **Report Templates**: Predefined templates that dictate the structure and content of the reports.
- **Data Sources**: Various data sources from which the necessary information is extracted.
- **Report Generator**: The core module that processes the templates and data to produce the final reports.

# Data flow and process

The data flow for automatic report generation typically follows these steps:

1. **Template Selection**: The system selects the appropriate report template based on the type of report to be generated.
2. **Data Extraction**: Relevant data is extracted from the specified data sources.
3. **Report Compilation**: The extracted data is compiled into the selected template.
4. **Report Generation**: The final report is generated and formatted according to the template specifications.
5. **Distribution**: The generated report is distributed to the intended recipients or stored in a designated location.

# Data flow and process

The `generate_report` function is responsible for compiling the data into the report template and generating the final report. This function takes the extracted data and processes it according to the template specifications.

# Example usage and scenarios

Automatic report generation can be used in various scenarios, such as:

- **Monthly Financial Reports**: Automatically generating financial statements at the end of each month.
- **Sales Reports**: Creating daily or weekly sales reports to track performance.
- **Compliance Reports**: Generating reports required for regulatory compliance on a scheduled basis.
