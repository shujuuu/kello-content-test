  Integration of EDI transactions and SBP payment slip generation within the
  system

This document will cover the integration of EDI transactions and SBP payment slip generation within the Kello Imagens system. We'll cover:

1. Overview of EDI transactions
2. Overview of SBP payment slip generation
3. Integration of EDI transactions and SBP payment slip generation

# Overview of EDI transactions

Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transactions are used to exchange business documents between systems in a standardized electronic format. In the Kello Imagens system, EDI transactions facilitate communication with banks and other financial institutions for various operations, such as payment processing and report generation.

# Overview of SBP payment slip generation

SBP (Standard Bank Payment) payment slip generation is a feature in the Kello Imagens system that automates the creation of payment slips according to the standard formats required by banks. This ensures compliance with banking regulations and streamlines the payment process for users.

# Integration of EDI transactions and SBP payment slip generation

The integration of EDI transactions and SBP payment slip generation within the Kello Imagens system is designed to ensure seamless and automated financial operations. The system generates SBP payment slips and uses EDI transactions to communicate these slips to the respective banks for processing. This integration involves several steps:

# Integration of EDI transactions and SBP payment slip generation

The `generate_edi_transaction` function is responsible for creating EDI transactions based on the generated SBP payment slips. This function formats the payment data into the required EDI format and prepares it for transmission to the bank.

The `create_sbp_payment_slip` function generates the SBP payment slips. It collects the necessary payment information, formats it according to the bank's standards, and stores it in the system for further processing.

The `integrate_edi_sbp` function coordinates the integration process. It calls the `create_sbp_payment_slip` function to generate the payment slips and then uses the `generate_edi_transaction` function to create the corresponding EDI transactions. This ensures that the payment slips are automatically communicated to the banks for processing.
