title: Integration of SBP payment slips in Kello Imagens
---
This document will cover the integration for SBP payment slips, which includes:

1. Generating SBP payment slips
2. Handling bank-specific EDI transactions
3. Automatic report generation.

# Generating SBP Payment Slips

The integration for SBP payment slips involves generating standard payment slips that comply with the SBP (Sistema de Boletos de Pagamento) format. This process ensures that the payment slips are recognized and processed by Brazilian banks. The generation of these slips is automated within the Kello Imagens system, reducing manual effort and errors.

# Handling Bank-Specific EDI Transactions

The system also handles Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transactions specific to different banks. This involves formatting the payment slip data according to the requirements of each bank's EDI system. The integration ensures that the payment slips can be electronically transmitted and processed by the banks, facilitating seamless transactions.

# Automatic Report Generation

In addition to generating payment slips and handling EDI transactions, the system also features automatic report generation. This functionality provides users with detailed reports on the status of payment slips, including which slips have been paid, which are pending, and any discrepancies. These reports are crucial for maintaining accurate financial records and ensuring compliance with banking regulations.
