title: Integration of the backup process with system components and external storage
---
This document will cover how the backup process integrates with other system components and external storage solutions. We'll cover:

1. Integration with system components
2. Integration with external storage solutions

# Integration with system components

The backup process in Kello Imagens is designed to seamlessly integrate with various system components. This is achieved through the use of the <SwmToken path="src/kello/itau.cbl" pos="91:1:3" line-data="       WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.">`WORKING-STORAGE`</SwmToken> SECTION in COBOL, which includes several COPY statements to import necessary modules and configurations. For example, in the file <SwmPath>[src/kello/itau.cbl](src/kello/itau.cbl)</SwmPath>, the <SwmToken path="src/kello/itau.cbl" pos="91:1:3" line-data="       WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.">`WORKING-STORAGE`</SwmToken> SECTION includes COPY statements for modules like <SwmToken path="src/kello/itau.cbl" pos="92:3:3" line-data="           COPY IMPRESSORA.">`IMPRESSORA`</SwmToken>, <SwmToken path="src/kello/itau.cbl" pos="93:4:6" line-data="           COPY &quot;ITAU.CPB&quot;.">`ITAU.CPB`</SwmToken>, <SwmToken path="src/kello/itau.cbl" pos="94:4:6" line-data="           COPY &quot;ITAU.CPY&quot;.">`ITAU.CPY`</SwmToken>, <SwmPath>[src/acp/ACP100/DS-CNTRL.MF](src/acp/ACP100/DS-CNTRL.MF)</SwmPath>, and <SwmPath>[src/acp/ACP100/CBPRINT.CPY](src/acp/ACP100/CBPRINT.CPY)</SwmPath>. These modules provide the necessary functionality for handling data and generating reports, which are crucial for the backup process.

# Integration with system components

The <SwmToken path="src/kello/itau.cbl" pos="91:1:3" line-data="       WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.">`WORKING-STORAGE`</SwmToken> SECTION in <SwmPath>[src/kello/itau.cbl](src/kello/itau.cbl)</SwmPath> includes COPY statements for various modules that are essential for the backup process.

```cobol
       WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
           COPY IMPRESSORA.
           COPY "ITAU.CPB".
           COPY "ITAU.CPY".
           COPY "DS-CNTRL.MF".
           COPY "CBPRINT.CPY".
```

Similarly, other files like <SwmPath>[src/banks/itau.cbl](src/banks/itau.cbl)</SwmPath>, <SwmPath>[src/alt/altsbra2.cbl](src/alt/altsbra2.cbl)</SwmPath>, and <SwmPath>[src/kello/altsbra2.cbl](src/kello/altsbra2.cbl)</SwmPath> also include <SwmToken path="src/kello/itau.cbl" pos="91:1:3" line-data="       WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.">`WORKING-STORAGE`</SwmToken> SECTIONS with COPY statements for different modules. These modules ensure that the backup process can access and manage data from various parts of the system, making it an integral part of the overall system architecture.

```cobol
       WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
           COPY "ALTSBRAD.CPB".
           COPY "ALTSBRAD.CPY".

# Integration with external storage solutions

The backup process also integrates with external storage solutions to ensure data is securely stored and can be easily retrieved when needed. This is typically done through EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) transactions and standard SBP (Sistema de Boletos de Pagamento) payment slip generation. These features are implemented in the COBOL code and are crucial for automating the backup and storage process.

# Integration with external storage solutions

For example, the file <SwmPath>[src/kello/itau.cbl](src/kello/itau.cbl)</SwmPath> includes definitions for various data fields and control areas that are used to manage EDI transactions and payment slips. These fields ensure that data is correctly formatted and transmitted to external storage solutions, making the backup process efficient and reliable.
