title: Integration of transaction histories with customer records
---
This document will cover the process of integrating transaction histories with customer records. We'll cover:

1. Storing transaction histories
2. Linking transactions to customer records
3. Retrieving integrated data

# Storing transaction histories

Transaction histories are stored in a dedicated table within the database. Each transaction record includes details such as transaction ID, date, amount, and customer ID. The customer ID is a foreign key that links the transaction to a specific customer.

# Storing transaction histories

The COBOL code in this section defines the structure of the transaction history table. It includes fields for transaction ID, date, amount, and customer ID.

# Linking transactions to customer records

To link transactions to customer records, the customer ID field in the transaction history table is used. This ID corresponds to the primary key in the customer records table, ensuring that each transaction is associated with the correct customer.

# Linking transactions to customer records

The COBOL code in this section defines the structure of the customer records table. The primary key is the customer ID, which is used to link to the transaction history table.

# Retrieving integrated data

To retrieve integrated data, a join operation is performed between the transaction history table and the customer records table using the customer ID. This allows for the extraction of comprehensive customer profiles that include their transaction histories.

# Retrieving integrated data

The COBOL code in this section performs a join operation between the transaction history table and the customer records table. It retrieves customer profiles along with their transaction histories.
