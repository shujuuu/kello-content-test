title: Integration points and implementation of bank-specific EDI transactions
---
This document will cover the key integration points for bank-specific EDI transactions and how they are implemented. We'll cover:

1. Overview of bank-specific EDI transactions
2. Key integration points
3. Implementation details

# Overview of bank-specific EDI transactions

Bank-specific EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) transactions in the Kello Imagens system are designed to facilitate automated communication between the system and various banks. These transactions include functionalities such as payment processing, report generation, and data synchronization.

# Key integration points

The key integration points for bank-specific EDI transactions are located in the <SwmPath>[src/banks/](src/banks/)</SwmPath> directory. This directory contains COBOL programs specific to different banks, such as <SwmPath>[src/banks/caixa.cbl](src/banks/caixa.cbl)</SwmPath>, <SwmPath>[src/banks/itau.cbl](src/banks/itau.cbl)</SwmPath>, and <SwmPath>[src/banks/hsbc.cbl](src/banks/hsbc.cbl)</SwmPath>. Each of these programs handles the EDI transactions for their respective banks.

# Implementation details

The implementation of bank-specific EDI transactions involves several steps:

1. **File Selection**: Each bank's EDI transactions are handled by a specific COBOL program located in the <SwmPath>[src/banks/](src/banks/)</SwmPath> directory.
2. **Data Handling**: The COBOL programs read and write data in the format required by each bank. This includes handling specific fields and record structures.
3. **Transaction Processing**: The programs process the EDI transactions by performing operations such as data validation, formatting, and communication with the bank's systems.
