This document will cover how different components like <SwmToken path="src/kello/mtp020.cbl" pos="3:6:6" line-data="       PROGRAM-ID. MTP020.">`MTP020`</SwmToken>, `crp053`, and `rep201` interact. We'll cover:

1. Overview of the components
2. Interaction between <SwmToken path="src/kello/mtp020.cbl" pos="3:6:6" line-data="       PROGRAM-ID. MTP020.">`MTP020`</SwmToken> and `crp053`
3. Interaction between <SwmToken path="src/kello/mtp020.cbl" pos="3:6:6" line-data="       PROGRAM-ID. MTP020.">`MTP020`</SwmToken> and `rep201`
4. Interaction between `crp053` and `rep201`

# Overview of the components

The components <SwmToken path="src/kello/mtp020.cbl" pos="3:6:6" line-data="       PROGRAM-ID. MTP020.">`MTP020`</SwmToken>, `crp053`, and `rep201` are part of the Kello Imagens business operations management system. Each component has a specific role within the system:

- <SwmToken path="src/kello/mtp020.cbl" pos="3:6:6" line-data="       PROGRAM-ID. MTP020.">`MTP020`</SwmToken>: Handles various forms and data related to the business operations.
- `crp053`: Manages specific report generation and data processing tasks.
- `rep201`: Responsible for generating detailed reports and handling data output.

# Interaction between `crp053` and `rep201`

The `crp053` component interacts with `rep201` through shared data structures and definitions. The <SwmPath>[src/acp/ACP100/CRPX020.CPY](src/acp/ACP100/CRPX020.CPY)</SwmPath> file includes references to `rep201`, allowing `crp053` to access reporting functionalities.

```cobol
          $set IDXFORMAT"4" FILETYPE"4"
          SELECT CRD020 ASSIGN TO PATH-CRD020
                  ORGANIZATION IS INDEXED
                  ACCESS MODE IS DYNAMIC
                  STATUS IS ST-CRD020
