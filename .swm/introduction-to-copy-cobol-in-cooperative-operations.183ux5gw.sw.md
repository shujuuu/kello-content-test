title: Introduction to Copy COBOL in Cooperative Operations
---
Copy COBOL refers to the use of the `COPY` statement in COBOL programs to include external files or code snippets into the program. This is particularly useful for reusing common code across multiple programs.

In Cooperative Operations, Copy COBOL is used to include predefined code segments, such as data structures, file descriptions, and common procedures, into the main program. This helps in maintaining consistency and reducing redundancy.

The `COPY` statement allows developers to manage and update code more efficiently. When a change is made to a copied file, all programs that include this file will automatically reflect the change, ensuring uniformity across the system.

In the provided code snippet, multiple `COPY` statements are used to include various files like `CAPW010`, `CAPW004`, and others. These files likely contain definitions and procedures that are essential for the program's operation.

Using Copy COBOL in Cooperative Operations enhances modularity and simplifies the development process by allowing developers to focus on specific parts of the program without worrying about the underlying common code.

## Example of Copy COBOL

In the provided code snippet, multiple `COPY` statements are used to include various files like `CAPW010`, `CAPW004`, and others. These files likely contain definitions and procedures that are essential for the program's operation.
