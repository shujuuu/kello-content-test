Inventory Control refers to the processes and systems used to manage and track the inventory levels, orders, sales, and deliveries of products. It ensures that the right amount of stock is maintained to meet customer demand without overstocking or understocking.

In Inventory Management, Inventory Control involves monitoring the flow of goods from manufacturers to warehouses and from these facilities to point of sale. It includes activities such as ordering, storing, and using the company's inventory.

Effective Inventory Control helps in reducing carrying costs, improving cash flow, and increasing the efficiency of the supply chain. It also involves the use of software systems to automate and streamline inventory tracking and management.
