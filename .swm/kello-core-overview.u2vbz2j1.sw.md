title: Kello Core Overview
---
Kello Core is the central part of the Kello Imagens business operations management system.

It is responsible for handling the main functionalities of the application, including automatic report generation and bank-specific EDI transactions.

The core also manages the generation of standard SBP payment slips, which are essential for the financial operations within the system.

The Kello Core is implemented in COBOL-85, ensuring compatibility with legacy systems and providing robust performance for business-critical operations.

It integrates various modules and components, such as those found in the <SwmPath>[src/kello/](src/kello/)</SwmPath> directory, to deliver comprehensive business management solutions.
