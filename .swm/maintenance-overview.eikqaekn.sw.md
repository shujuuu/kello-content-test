title: Maintenance Overview
---
Maintenance refers to the ongoing process of ensuring that the Kello Imagens system remains functional and up-to-date.

This involves regular updates to the COBOL-85 source code to fix bugs, improve performance, and add new features.

Maintenance also includes managing the configuration files to ensure they are correctly set up for the system's operation.

Another critical aspect of maintenance is the generation of automatic reports and handling bank-specific EDI transactions.

Regular maintenance tasks help in keeping the system compliant with the latest standards for SBP payment slip generation.

The maintenance process ensures that all components, including compiled files and source files, are correctly synchronized and functioning as intended.

## Regular Updates

Regular updates to the COBOL-85 source code are essential for fixing bugs, improving performance, and adding new features. This ensures the system remains efficient and capable of meeting new requirements.

## Configuration Management

Managing the configuration files is crucial to ensure they are correctly set up for the system's operation. Proper configuration management helps in maintaining the system's stability and functionality.

## Automatic Report Generation

Generating automatic reports is a key aspect of maintenance. These reports provide valuable insights and help in monitoring the system's performance and identifying areas that need attention.

## Handling EDI Transactions

Handling bank-specific EDI transactions is another critical maintenance task. This ensures that the system can communicate effectively with banking systems and process transactions accurately.

## Compliance with Standards

Regular maintenance tasks help in keeping the system compliant with the latest standards for SBP payment slip generation. This ensures that the system adheres to regulatory requirements and avoids potential legal issues.

## Synchronization of Components

The maintenance process ensures that all components, including compiled files and source files, are correctly synchronized and functioning as intended. This helps in preventing discrepancies and ensuring smooth operation.
