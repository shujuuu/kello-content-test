This document will cover how the system manages and organizes customer attributes. We'll cover:

1. Storing customer attributes
2. Retrieving customer attributes
3. Updating customer attributes
4. Deleting customer attributes

# Storing customer attributes

Customer attributes are stored in the system's database. Each customer has a unique identifier, and their attributes are stored in a structured format. The attributes can include name, address, contact information, and other relevant details.

# Storing customer attributes

The `STORE-CUSTOMER-ATTRIBUTES` procedure is responsible for storing customer attributes in the database. It takes the customer data as input and inserts it into the appropriate database tables.

# Retrieving customer attributes

To retrieve customer attributes, the system queries the database using the customer's unique identifier. The retrieved data is then formatted and returned to the requesting module.

# Retrieving customer attributes

The `RETRIEVE-CUSTOMER-ATTRIBUTES` procedure handles the retrieval of customer data from the database. It constructs a query based on the customer's unique identifier and fetches the corresponding attributes.

# Updating customer attributes

Updating customer attributes involves modifying the existing data in the database. The system ensures that the updated information is consistent and valid before committing the changes.

# Updating customer attributes

The `UPDATE-CUSTOMER-ATTRIBUTES` procedure is used to update existing customer data. It validates the new information and updates the relevant database records.

# Deleting customer attributes

When customer attributes need to be deleted, the system removes the corresponding records from the database. This operation is typically performed with caution to avoid accidental data loss.

# Deleting customer attributes

The `DELETE-CUSTOMER-ATTRIBUTES` procedure is responsible for deleting customer data from the database. It ensures that the records are properly removed and that any related data is also handled appropriately.
