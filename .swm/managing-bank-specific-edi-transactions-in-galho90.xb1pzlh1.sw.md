title: Managing Bank-Specific EDI Transactions in GALHO90
---
This document will cover how bank-specific EDI transactions are managed in the Kello Imagens system. We'll cover:

1. Overview of EDI transaction management
2. Key programs involved
3. Data flow and file handling

# Overview of EDI transaction management

Bank-specific EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) transactions in the Kello Imagens system are managed through various COBOL programs. These programs handle the creation, modification, and processing of EDI files specific to different banks. The directory <SwmPath>[src/banks/](src/banks/)</SwmPath> contains COBOL source files for different banks such as Caixa, Itau, and HSBC.

# Key programs involved

Several key programs are involved in managing bank-specific EDI transactions. These include <SwmToken path="src/alt/altseqbr.CBL" pos="3:6:6" line-data="       PROGRAM-ID. ALTSEQBR.">`ALTSEQBR`</SwmToken>, <SwmToken path="src/als/alseqbr9.CBL" pos="3:6:6" line-data="       PROGRAM-ID. ALSEQBR9.">`ALSEQBR9`</SwmToken>, and <SwmToken path="src/oep/oep030.cbl" pos="3:6:6" line-data="       PROGRAM-ID. OEP030.">`OEP030`</SwmToken>. Each program is responsible for different aspects of the EDI transaction process.

# Key programs involved

The program <SwmToken path="src/alt/altseqbr.CBL" pos="3:6:6" line-data="       PROGRAM-ID. ALTSEQBR.">`ALTSEQBR`</SwmToken> is used to alter the sequence for Banco do Brasil. It defines the file <SwmToken path="src/alt/altseqbr.CBL" pos="15:3:3" line-data="           SELECT SEQBRAS ASSIGN TO PATH-SEQBRA">`SEQBRAS`</SwmToken> and its structure, which is used to store sequence data.

# Data flow and file handling

The data flow for managing EDI transactions involves reading and writing to various files. The programs define file structures and paths, and use these to store and retrieve data necessary for EDI transactions.

<SwmSnippet path="/src/alt/altseqbr.CBL" line="25">

# Data flow and file handling

The file <SwmToken path="src/alt/altseqbr.CBL" pos="25:3:3" line-data="       FD  SEQBRAS.">`SEQBRAS`</SwmToken> is defined with a record structure that includes a sequence number. This file is used by multiple programs to manage sequence data for EDI transactions.

```cobol
       FD  SEQBRAS.
       01  REG-SEQBRAS.
           05  CONT-SEQUENCIA  PIC 9.
           05  SEQUENCIA       PIC 9(10).
