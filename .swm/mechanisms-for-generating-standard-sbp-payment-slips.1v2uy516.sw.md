title: Mechanisms for Generating Standard SBP Payment Slips
---
This document will cover the mechanisms used to generate standard SBP payment slips, which includes:

1. The purpose of SBP payment slips
2. The process of generating SBP payment slips
3. Key components involved in the generation

# The purpose of SBP payment slips

SBP payment slips are standardized documents used for processing payments through the Brazilian Payment System (Sistema de Pagamentos Brasileiro - SBP). These slips contain essential information such as the payer's details, payment amount, due date, and a barcode for processing the payment through banks and other financial institutions.

# The process of generating SBP payment slips

The generation of SBP payment slips involves several steps, including data collection, formatting, and encoding the information into a standardized format. This process ensures that the payment slips are compliant with SBP regulations and can be processed by banks and other financial institutions.

# Key components involved in the generation

The key components involved in generating SBP payment slips include:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering necessary information such as payer details, payment amount, and due date.
2. **Formatting**: Structuring the collected data into the required format for SBP payment slips.
3. **Encoding**: Converting the formatted data into a barcode that can be scanned and processed by banks.
4. **Report Generation**: Creating a printable version of the payment slip that includes all the necessary information and the barcode.

# Key components involved in the generation

The `sbp_payment_slip_generator.cbl` file contains the COBOL code responsible for generating the SBP payment slips. This code handles data collection, formatting, and encoding the information into a barcode.

The section of the code from lines 50 to 70 demonstrates how the collected data is formatted into the required structure for SBP payment slips.

The section of the code from lines 90 to 110 shows how the formatted data is encoded into a barcode that can be scanned and processed by banks.
