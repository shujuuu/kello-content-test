title: Methods used for securely storing customer data
---
This document will cover the methods used for securely storing customer data, which includes:

1. Encryption techniques
2. Access control mechanisms
3. Data backup and recovery.

# Encryption techniques

Encryption is a fundamental method for securely storing customer data. It involves converting data into a coded format that can only be read by someone who has the decryption key. In the context of Kello Imagens, encryption ensures that sensitive customer information is protected from unauthorized access. Common encryption algorithms include AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman).

# Access control mechanisms

Access control mechanisms are essential for ensuring that only authorized personnel can access customer data. This involves implementing user authentication and authorization processes. In Kello Imagens, access control can be managed through user roles and permissions, ensuring that users can only access data relevant to their role. For example, a customer service representative may have access to customer contact information but not to financial data.

# Data backup and recovery

Data backup and recovery are critical components of securely storing customer data. Regular backups ensure that data can be restored in case of accidental deletion, corruption, or a security breach. In Kello Imagens, data backups should be performed regularly and stored in a secure, off-site location. Recovery procedures should be tested periodically to ensure that data can be restored quickly and accurately.
