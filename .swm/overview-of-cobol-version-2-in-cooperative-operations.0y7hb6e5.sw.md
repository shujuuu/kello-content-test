title: Overview of COBOL Version 2 in Cooperative Operations
---
COBOL Version 2 is a specific version of the COBOL programming language used in the Kello Imagens system.

It is utilized for various business operations, including automatic report generation and bank-specific EDI transactions.

The system leverages COBOL Version 2 to handle standard SBP payment slip generation, ensuring compliance with financial regulations.

The codebase includes numerous COBOL programs and copybooks that define the structure and logic for these operations.

These programs are organized into different sections such as the Identification Division, Environment Division, Data Division, and Procedure Division.

Each section plays a crucial role in defining the program's metadata, environment settings, data structures, and executable logic.

# Identification Division

The Identification Division provides metadata about the program, such as the program ID, author, and date written.

# Environment Division

The Environment Division specifies the environment in which the program will run, including special names and class control.

# Data Division

The Data Division defines the data structures used in the program. It includes file sections and working-storage sections.

# Procedure Division

The Procedure Division contains the executable logic of the program. It includes various procedures and routines that perform specific tasks.
