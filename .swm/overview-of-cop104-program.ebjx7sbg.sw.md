# Initializing the Program

The COP104 program begins by accepting parameters from the command line. This step is crucial as it sets up the initial conditions and configurations needed for the program to run correctly. The parameters might include details such as the date range for processing contracts or specific flags that control the program's behavior.

# Processing Contract Data

In this step, the program processes contract data by moving initial and final month-year values and starting a key-based search on the contract database. It iterates through records to move relevant data to the working storage. This ensures that only the necessary contract data is processed, which improves efficiency and accuracy.

# Moving Data to Working Storage

The program initializes the working storage and performs various data movements and calculations. It reads records, checks conditions, and moves data to appropriate fields. This step ensures that all necessary information is prepared for further processing. For example, it might move city data and read additional records to populate the working storage.

# Performing Calculations and Finalizing Data

In this final step, the program performs various calculations, such as computing the total cost and commission values. It also prepares data for screen display and writes the final working record. This step is essential for transforming raw data into meaningful business information that can be used for reporting and decision-making.
