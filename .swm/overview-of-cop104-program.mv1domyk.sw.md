# Initializing the Program

The COP104 program begins by initializing and setting up the main processing loop. This involves accepting parameters from the command line and preparing the system for further operations. This step ensures that all necessary configurations are in place before any data processing begins.

# Processing Contract Data

In this step, the program processes contract data by reading records from the COD040 file. It moves date values into working storage and performs operations until a specific condition is met. This ensures that all relevant contract data is accurately captured and prepared for further processing.

# Moving Data to Working Storage

The program then moves data to working storage, where it performs various calculations and updates fields. This step is crucial for ensuring that all data is correctly formatted and ready for any subsequent operations. It involves reading records from multiple files, updating fields, and performing computations related to commissions, dates, and other contract-related data.

# Handling Sales and Production Data

Finally, the program handles sales and production data by processing date ranges, calculating commissions, and writing the final work record. This step ensures that all sales and production data is accurately processed and recorded, providing a comprehensive overview of business operations.
