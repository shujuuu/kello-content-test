title: Overview of Financial Reports
---
Reports are essential for summarizing and presenting financial data in a structured format. They provide insights into various financial operations, such as cash flow, bank transactions, and payment slips.

The function <SwmToken path="src/cop/cop110.cbl" pos="330:3:5" line-data="                       PERFORM IMPRIME-RELATORIO">`IMPRIME-RELATORIO`</SwmToken> is responsible for generating these reports. It opens the necessary input files, initializes variables, and performs various operations to format and print the report lines.

The <SwmToken path="src/cop/cop110.cbl" pos="323:1:3" line-data="       CORPO-PROGRAMA SECTION.">`CORPO-PROGRAMA`</SwmToken> section coordinates the report generation process by calling the <SwmToken path="src/cop/cop110.cbl" pos="330:3:5" line-data="                       PERFORM IMPRIME-RELATORIO">`IMPRIME-RELATORIO`</SwmToken> function when the `FIN001-PRINTER-FLG-TRUE` condition is met.

Additionally, the <SwmToken path="src/cop/cop110.cbl" pos="332:5:7" line-data="               WHEN GS-CARREGA-LISTA-FLG-TRUE">`CARREGA-LISTA`</SwmToken> function is used to prepare and load data into the report, ensuring that all relevant financial information is included.
