title: Procedures for data consistency with external bank systems
---
This document will cover the procedures in place to maintain data consistency with external bank systems. We'll cover:

1. EDI Transactions
2. SBP Payment Slip Generation
3. Automatic Report Generation

# EDI Transactions

Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transactions are used to ensure data consistency with external bank systems. These transactions follow specific formats and protocols that are agreed upon by both the sending and receiving parties. In the context of Kello Imagens, EDI transactions are implemented to handle bank-specific data exchanges, ensuring that the data sent to and received from banks is accurate and consistent.

# EDI Transactions

The `process_edi_transaction` procedure is responsible for formatting and sending data to the bank. It ensures that the data adheres to the bank's specifications, thereby maintaining consistency.

# SBP Payment Slip Generation

Standard SBP (Sistema de Boletos de Pagamento) payment slip generation is another critical procedure for maintaining data consistency with external bank systems. These payment slips must follow strict formatting rules to be accepted by banks. The system generates these slips automatically, ensuring that all required fields are correctly filled and formatted.

# SBP Payment Slip Generation

The `generate_sbp_slip` procedure is responsible for creating payment slips that comply with SBP standards. This ensures that the slips are accepted by banks without errors, maintaining data consistency.

# Automatic Report Generation

Automatic report generation is used to create consistent and accurate reports that can be shared with external bank systems. These reports include transaction summaries, account statements, and other financial data. The system ensures that the data in these reports is up-to-date and formatted correctly.

# Automatic Report Generation

The `generate_report` procedure automates the creation of financial reports. It pulls data from various sources within the system, formats it according to predefined templates, and ensures that the final report is consistent and accurate.
