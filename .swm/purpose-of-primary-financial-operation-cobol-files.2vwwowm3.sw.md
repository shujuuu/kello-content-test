title: Purpose of primary financial operation COBOL files
---
This document will explain the purpose of some primary financial operation COBOL files, specifically <SwmPath>[src/acp/acp020.CBL](src/acp/acp020.CBL)</SwmPath> and <SwmPath>[src/crp/crp053.cbl](src/crp/crp053.cbl)</SwmPath>. We'll cover:

1. The purpose of <SwmPath>[src/acp/acp020.CBL](src/acp/acp020.CBL)</SwmPath>
2. The purpose of <SwmPath>[src/crp/crp053.cbl](src/crp/crp053.cbl)</SwmPath>

# The purpose of <SwmPath>[src/acp/acp020.CBL](src/acp/acp020.CBL)</SwmPath>

The file <SwmPath>[src/acp/acp020.CBL](src/acp/acp020.CBL)</SwmPath> is used for customer service operations. It is designed to handle customer service requests and manage customer interactions. The program is identified as <SwmToken path="src/acp/Acp010.cbl" pos="3:6:6" line-data="       PROGRAM-ID. ACP010.">`ACP010`</SwmToken> and was authored by Mareli Am√¢ncio Volpato on <SwmToken path="src/acp/Acp010.cbl" pos="5:5:9" line-data="      *DATA: 14/03/2004">`14/03/2004`</SwmToken>.

```cobol
       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
       PROGRAM-ID. ACP010.
      *AUTORA: MARELI AMANCIO VOLPATO
      *DATA: 14/03/2004

The main process section of <SwmPath>[src/acp/acp020.CBL](src/acp/acp020.CBL)</SwmPath> initializes the program and performs the core operations until the exit flag is set to true. This indicates that the program runs in a loop to continuously handle customer service requests.

```cobol
       MAIN-PROCESS SECTION.
           PERFORM INICIALIZA-PROGRAMA.
           PERFORM CORPO-PROGRAMA UNTIL GS-EXIT-FLG-TRUE.
           GO FINALIZAR-PROGRAMA.
