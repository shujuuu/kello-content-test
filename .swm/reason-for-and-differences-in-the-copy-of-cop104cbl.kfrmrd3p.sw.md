title: Reason for and Differences in the Copy of cop104.cbl
---
This document will cover the reasons for creating a copy of the original <SwmPath>[tests/BUILD/cop104.cbl](tests/BUILD/cop104.cbl)</SwmPath> file and the differences between the original and the copied versions. We'll cover:

1. Why a copy of the original <SwmPath>[tests/BUILD/cop104.cbl](tests/BUILD/cop104.cbl)</SwmPath> file was created
2. Differences between the original and copied versions

# Why a copy of the original <SwmPath>[tests/BUILD/cop104.cbl](tests/BUILD/cop104.cbl)</SwmPath> file was created

A copy of the original <SwmPath>[tests/BUILD/cop104.cbl](tests/BUILD/cop104.cbl)</SwmPath> file was created to facilitate testing and development without affecting the production version. This allows developers to make changes, run tests, and debug the program in an isolated environment. The copied versions, <SwmPath>[tests/BUILD/cop104.cbl](tests/BUILD/cop104.cbl)</SwmPath> and <SwmPath>[tests/BUILD/cop104-2.cbl](tests/BUILD/cop104-2.cbl)</SwmPath>, are located in the <SwmPath>[tests/BUILD/](tests/BUILD/)</SwmPath> directory, indicating their use for testing purposes.

# Differences between the original and copied versions

The copied version <SwmPath>[tests/BUILD/cop104.cbl](tests/BUILD/cop104.cbl)</SwmPath> includes additional comments and modifications for testing purposes. For example, lines 6-8 contain comments that describe the program and its function, similar to the original but with added details for clarity.

```cobol
      *PROGRAMA: RelatÃ³rio 05
      * LISTAR APENAS OS CONTRATOS ATIVOS, OU SEJA, STATUS => 50
      * - CONTRATOS A EXECUTAR SÃƒO OS CONTRATOS QUE NÃƒO FORAM VENDIDOS

Lines 990-999 in <SwmPath>[tests/BUILD/cop104.cbl](tests/BUILD/cop104.cbl)</SwmPath> include conditional display statements for debugging, which are not present in the original file. These lines help developers verify the values of certain variables during execution.

```cobol
