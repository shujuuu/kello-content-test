# Overview of report generation

Report generation in the Kello Imagens system is a crucial feature that automates the creation of various business reports. These reports are generated based on the data stored in the system and are used for business analysis, decision-making, and compliance purposes.

# Key components involved

The report generation process involves several key components:

- **Data Source**: The data stored in the system's database.
- **Report Templates**: Predefined templates that dictate the structure and format of the reports.
- **Report Generator**: The module responsible for fetching data, applying it to the templates, and generating the final report.

# Data flow and processing

The data flow for report generation typically follows these steps:

1. **Data Retrieval**: The report generator fetches the required data from the database.
2. **Template Application**: The fetched data is applied to the predefined report templates.
3. **Report Creation**: The final report is generated in the desired format (e.g., PDF, Excel).
4. **Distribution**: The generated report is distributed to the relevant stakeholders or stored for future reference.

# Example of report generation

The following code snippet demonstrates a simplified example of the report generation process in COBOL. The `GENERATE-REPORT` procedure fetches data, applies it to a template, and generates the final report.
