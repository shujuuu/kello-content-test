title: Roles of Key Programs like crp062.cbl and crp100.cbl in Accounts Receivable
---
This document will cover the key roles of the program <SwmPath>[src/crp/crp062.cbl](src/crp/crp062.cbl)</SwmPath> in the Kello Imagens system. We'll cover:

1. The purpose of <SwmPath>[src/crp/crp062.cbl](src/crp/crp062.cbl)</SwmPath>
2. How <SwmPath>[src/crp/crp062.cbl](src/crp/crp062.cbl)</SwmPath> is structured
3. Key sections and their roles

# The purpose of <SwmPath>[src/crp/crp062.cbl](src/crp/crp062.cbl)</SwmPath>

The program <SwmPath>[src/crp/crp062.cbl](src/crp/crp062.cbl)</SwmPath> is designed to generate a report for duplicate transfers. This is indicated in the comments and metadata at the beginning of the file.

```cobol
       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
       PROGRAM-ID. CRP062.
       DATE-WRITTEN. 12/07/2005.
       AUTHOR. ALFREDO SAVIOLLI NETO.
      *FUNÇÃO: RELATORIO DUPLICATAS PARA TRANSFERENCIA.

# How <SwmPath>[src/crp/crp062.cbl](src/crp/crp062.cbl)</SwmPath> is structured

The structure of <SwmPath>[src/crp/crp062.cbl](src/crp/crp062.cbl)</SwmPath> follows the standard COBOL program layout with divisions such as IDENTIFICATION, ENVIRONMENT, and DATA. The <SwmToken path="src/crp/crp062.cbl" pos="8:1:3" line-data="       SPECIAL-NAMES.">`SPECIAL-NAMES`</SwmToken> clause specifies the decimal point and printer settings.

```cobol

      *FUNÇÃO: RELATORIO DUPLICATAS PARA TRANSFERENCIA.
       ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.
       SPECIAL-NAMES.
         DECIMAL-POINT IS COMMA
         PRINTER IS LPRINTER.
