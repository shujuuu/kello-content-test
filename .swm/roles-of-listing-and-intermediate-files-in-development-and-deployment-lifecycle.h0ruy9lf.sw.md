  Roles of Listing and Intermediate Files in Development and Deployment
  Lifecycle
---
This document will cover the roles of listing ('.LST') and intermediate ('.GS', '.OBJ') files in the development and deployment lifecycle. We'll cover:

1. What are listing files
2. What are intermediate files
3. How these files are used in the development lifecycle
4. How these files are used in the deployment lifecycle.

# What are listing files

Listing files ('.LST') are generated during the compilation process and contain a detailed record of the compilation. They include information such as the source code, compiler options, error messages, and other diagnostic information. These files are crucial for debugging and understanding the compilation process.

# What are listing files

The listing file <SwmPath>[app/last_known_compilation/compiler_control_files/RCP202.LST](app/last_known_compilation/compiler_control_files/RCP202.LST)</SwmPath> shows the compiler options used during the compilation of the <SwmToken path="app/last_known_compilation/compiler_control_files/RCP202.LST" pos="3:26:26" line-data="* Options: NOLIST NOASMLIST OMF(OBJ) GNT(.\) OBJ(.\) gnt&quot;rcp202.OBJ&quot;">`rcp202`</SwmToken> program. It includes options like <SwmToken path="app/last_known_compilation/compiler_control_files/RCP202.LST" pos="3:5:5" line-data="* Options: NOLIST NOASMLIST OMF(OBJ) GNT(.\) OBJ(.\) gnt&quot;rcp202.OBJ&quot;">`NOLIST`</SwmToken>, <SwmToken path="app/last_known_compilation/compiler_control_files/RCP202.LST" pos="3:7:7" line-data="* Options: NOLIST NOASMLIST OMF(OBJ) GNT(.\) OBJ(.\) gnt&quot;rcp202.OBJ&quot;">`NOASMLIST`</SwmToken>, and <SwmToken path="app/last_known_compilation/compiler_control_files/RCP202.LST" pos="3:9:12" line-data="* Options: NOLIST NOASMLIST OMF(OBJ) GNT(.\) OBJ(.\) gnt&quot;rcp202.OBJ&quot;">`OMF(OBJ)`</SwmToken>.

```lst
* Options: NOLIST NOASMLIST OMF(OBJ) GNT(.\) OBJ(.\) gnt"rcp202.OBJ"
*          obj"rcp202.OBJ" list"RCP202.LST" ERRLIST

# What are intermediate files

Intermediate files ('.GS', '.OBJ') are generated during the compilation process and serve as transitional representations of the source code. The '.GS' files are often used for storing intermediate data structures or code, while '.OBJ' files are object files that contain machine code generated by the compiler. These files are essential for linking and creating the final executable.

# What are intermediate files

The file <SwmPath>[app/last_known_compilation/Dialog_System_Screenset_scripts/RCP202.GS](app/last_known_compilation/Dialog_System_Screenset_scripts/RCP202.GS)</SwmPath> is an intermediate file generated during the compilation of the <SwmToken path="app/last_known_compilation/compiler_control_files/RCP202.LST" pos="3:26:26" line-data="* Options: NOLIST NOASMLIST OMF(OBJ) GNT(.\) OBJ(.\) gnt&quot;rcp202.OBJ&quot;">`rcp202`</SwmToken> program. Similarly, <SwmPath>[app/last_known_compilation/object_code_files/rcp202.OBJ](app/last_known_compilation/object_code_files/rcp202.OBJ)</SwmPath> is the object file generated during the same process.

# How these files are used in the development lifecycle

During development, listing files are used to debug and verify the compilation process. Developers can review these files to identify and fix errors in the source code. Intermediate files are used to store transitional representations of the code, which are then linked to create the final executable. These files help in optimizing the code and ensuring that it is correctly translated into machine code.

# How these files are used in the development lifecycle

The <SwmToken path="app/last_known_compilation/compiler_control_files/RCP202.LST" pos="3:26:26" line-data="* Options: NOLIST NOASMLIST OMF(OBJ) GNT(.\) OBJ(.\) gnt&quot;rcp202.OBJ&quot;">`rcp202`</SwmToken> program goes through several stages during its execution, including initialization, main processing, and finalization. Intermediate files like <SwmPath>[app/last_known_compilation/Dialog_System_Screenset_scripts/RCP202.GS](app/last_known_compilation/Dialog_System_Screenset_scripts/RCP202.GS)</SwmPath> and <SwmPath>[app/last_known_compilation/object_code_files/rcp202.OBJ](app/last_known_compilation/object_code_files/rcp202.OBJ)</SwmPath> are generated during these stages to facilitate the compilation and linking process.

```cobol
       MAIN-PROCESS SECTION.
           PERFORM INICIALIZA-PROGRAMA.
           PERFORM CORPO-PROGRAMA UNTIL GS-EXIT-FLG-TRUE.
           GO FINALIZAR-PROGRAMA.
```

# How these files are used in the deployment lifecycle

In the deployment lifecycle, intermediate files are linked to create the final executable that is deployed to the production environment. Listing files are used to ensure that the compilation process was successful and to verify that there are no errors or issues in the generated code. These files are also useful for maintaining a record of the compilation process for future reference.

# How these files are used in the deployment lifecycle

The listing file <SwmPath>[app/last_known_compilation/compiler_control_files/OEP030.LST](app/last_known_compilation/compiler_control_files/OEP030.LST)</SwmPath> includes compiler options and diagnostic information for the <SwmToken path="app/last_known_compilation/compiler_control_files/OEP030.LST" pos="3:26:26" line-data="* Options: NOLIST NOASMLIST OMF(OBJ) GNT(.\) OBJ(.\) gnt&quot;oep030.OBJ&quot;">`oep030`</SwmToken> program. This information is crucial for verifying the compilation process during deployment.

```lst
* Options: NOLIST NOASMLIST OMF(OBJ) GNT(.\) OBJ(.\) gnt"oep030.OBJ"
*          obj"oep030.OBJ" list"OEP030.LST" ERRLIST
