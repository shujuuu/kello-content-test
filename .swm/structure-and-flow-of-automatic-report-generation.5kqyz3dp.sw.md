# Overview of automatic report generation

Automatic report generation in Kello Imagens is a feature designed to streamline the creation of business reports. This functionality is crucial for providing timely and accurate information to stakeholders without manual intervention.

# Key components involved

The automatic report generation system involves several key components:

- **Report Templates**: Predefined templates that dictate the structure and content of the reports.
- **Data Sources**: Various databases and data files from which the report data is extracted.
- **Report Generator**: The core module that processes the templates and data to produce the final reports.
- **Scheduler**: A component that triggers the report generation process at specified intervals or events.

# Data flow and process

The data flow and process for automatic report generation can be summarized in the following steps:

1. **Template Selection**: The system selects the appropriate report template based on the type of report to be generated.
2. **Data Extraction**: Relevant data is extracted from the specified data sources.
3. **Data Processing**: The extracted data is processed and formatted according to the rules defined in the report template.
4. **Report Generation**: The processed data is merged with the template to create the final report.
5. **Report Distribution**: The generated report is distributed to the intended recipients via email, saved to a file system, or uploaded to a web portal.

# Example usage

Consider a scenario where a monthly sales report needs to be generated automatically:

1. The scheduler triggers the report generation process on the first day of each month.
2. The system selects the 'Monthly Sales Report' template.
3. Data for the past month's sales is extracted from the sales database.
4. The data is processed to calculate totals, averages, and other metrics.
5. The final report is generated and emailed to the sales team and management.
