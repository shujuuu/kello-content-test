title: Structure and Management of SBP Payment Slip
---
This document will cover the structure and management of SBP payment slips, which includes:

1. The structure of SBP payment slips
2. How SBP payment slips are managed in the system.

# The structure of SBP payment slips

SBP payment slips are standardized documents used for processing payments in Brazil. They typically include fields such as the payer's information, the recipient's information, the amount to be paid, due date, and a barcode for processing the payment. The structure is designed to comply with the regulations set by the Brazilian Federation of Banks (FEBRABAN).

# The structure of SBP payment slips

The code defines the layout of the SBP payment slip, including fields for payer's name, recipient's name, amount, due date, and barcode. This ensures that all necessary information is captured and formatted correctly for processing.

# How SBP payment slips are managed in the system

The management of SBP payment slips involves generating, storing, and processing these slips within the Kello Imagens system. The system ensures that each slip is generated with accurate information and stored securely for future reference and processing.

# How SBP payment slips are managed in the system

This section of the code handles the generation of SBP payment slips. It pulls data from the database, formats it according to the SBP standards, and generates the slip for printing or electronic distribution.

This part of the code is responsible for storing the generated SBP payment slips in the system's database. It ensures that each slip is saved with a unique identifier and can be retrieved for future processing or auditing.

The code here deals with the processing of SBP payment slips. It includes functions for validating the slip's information, updating the payment status, and generating reports for reconciliation.
