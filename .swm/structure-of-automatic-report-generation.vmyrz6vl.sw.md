# Overview of automatic report generation

Automatic report generation in Kello Imagens is designed to streamline the creation of business reports without manual intervention. This feature leverages predefined templates and data sources to produce reports that are consistent and accurate.

# Key components involved

The main components involved in automatic report generation include:

- **Templates**: Predefined formats for different types of reports.
- **Data Sources**: Databases or files from which data is extracted.
- **Report Generator**: The core logic that combines templates and data to produce the final report.

# Data flow and process

The data flow for automatic report generation typically follows these steps:

1. **Data Extraction**: Data is extracted from the specified sources.
2. **Template Selection**: The appropriate template is selected based on the report type.
3. **Data Integration**: Extracted data is integrated into the template.
4. **Report Generation**: The final report is generated and formatted.
5. **Distribution**: The report is distributed to the intended recipients.

# Data flow and process

The `report_generator` module is responsible for integrating data into templates and generating the final report. It includes functions for data extraction, template selection, and report formatting.

# Example use cases

Automatic report generation can be used in various scenarios such as:

- **Monthly Sales Reports**: Automatically generate sales reports at the end of each month.
- **Inventory Reports**: Generate inventory status reports based on real-time data.
- **Financial Statements**: Produce financial statements for quarterly reviews.
