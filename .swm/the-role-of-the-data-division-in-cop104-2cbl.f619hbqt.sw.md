title: The Role of the Data Division in cop104-2.cbl
---
This document will cover the role of the Data Division in defining data structures in COBOL programs, specifically in the file <SwmPath>[src/cop/cop104-2.cbl](src/cop/cop104-2.cbl)</SwmPath>. We'll cover:

1. What is the Data Division
2. How the Data Division is used in <SwmPath>[src/cop/cop104-2.cbl](src/cop/cop104-2.cbl)</SwmPath>
3. Examples of Data Division usage in other files

# What is the Data Division

The Data Division in COBOL is one of the four main divisions of a COBOL program. It is used to define all the variables, constants, and data structures that the program will use. The Data Division is essential for setting up the data environment for the program's execution.

# How the Data Division is used in <SwmPath>[src/cop/cop104-2.cbl](src/cop/cop104-2.cbl)</SwmPath>

In the file <SwmPath>[src/cop/cop104-2.cbl](src/cop/cop104-2.cbl)</SwmPath>, the Data Division is defined starting at line 72. It includes a FILE SECTION and a COPY statement to include the contents of another file, <SwmToken path="src/cop/cop104-2.cbl" pos="74:3:3" line-data="       COPY CAPW010.">`CAPW010`</SwmToken>. This setup indicates that the program will use the data structures defined in <SwmToken path="src/cop/cop104-2.cbl" pos="74:3:3" line-data="       COPY CAPW010.">`CAPW010`</SwmToken>.

```cobol
       DATA DIVISION.
       FILE SECTION.
       COPY CAPW010.
```

# Examples of Data Division usage in other files

In the file <SwmPath>[src/kello/cbp105.cbl](src/kello/cbp105.cbl)</SwmPath>, the Data Division is defined starting at line 27. Similar to <SwmPath>[src/cop/cop104-2.cbl](src/cop/cop104-2.cbl)</SwmPath>, it includes a FILE SECTION and a COPY statement to include the contents of <SwmToken path="src/kello/cbp105.cbl" pos="29:3:3" line-data="       COPY CBPW001.">`CBPW001`</SwmToken>.

```cobol
       DATA DIVISION.
       FILE SECTION.
       COPY CBPW001.
