title: The structure of report templates in COBOL
---
This document will cover the structure of report templates in COBOL, which includes:

1. Defining the report template structure
2. Using the report template in COBOL programs.

# Defining the report template structure

In COBOL, report templates are typically defined using a combination of data division entries and procedure division logic. The data division is used to declare the structure of the report, including headers, footers, and detail lines. The procedure division contains the logic to populate and format these sections.

# Defining the report template structure

The <SwmToken path="src/log002.cbl" pos="407:1:5" line-data="       060-processar-cobol section.">`060-processar-cobol`</SwmToken> section in <SwmPath>[src/log002.cbl](src/log002.cbl)</SwmPath> demonstrates how different report sections are processed based on the value of <SwmToken path="src/log002.cbl" pos="409:3:5" line-data="           evaluate fun-cobol">`fun-cobol`</SwmToken>. This section evaluates the function code and performs the corresponding section to handle different parts of the report.

```cobol
       060-processar-cobol section.
           move spaces to mensagem
           evaluate fun-cobol
              when "A" perform 070-instanciar-Janela
                       perform montar-listview

              when "C" perform 060a-criticar-campo
              when "S" perform sugestao
              when "L" perform carregar-consulta
              when "e" perform tratar-eventos
              when "+" perform evento-alterados

           end-evaluate.
           move spaces to fun-cobol.

           end-evaluate.

# Using the report template in COBOL programs

Once the report template is defined, it can be used in COBOL programs to generate reports. The procedure division will contain the logic to populate the report with data, format it, and output it to the desired medium (e.g., screen, printer, file).

This section includes logic for centralizing, criticizing, suggesting, navigating, including, and printing labels, which are all parts of the report generation process.
