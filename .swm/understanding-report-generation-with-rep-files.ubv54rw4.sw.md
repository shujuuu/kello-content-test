title: Understanding report generation with rep files
---
This document will cover how the system handles report generation using `.rep` files. We'll cover:

1. File Control Definitions
2. Data Division and File Section
3. Report Generation Process

# File Control Definitions

The <SwmToken path="src/kello/rep203.cbl" pos="17:1:3" line-data="       FILE-CONTROL.">`FILE-CONTROL`</SwmToken> paragraph defines the files used in the report generation process. It includes various <SwmToken path="src/kello/rep203.cbl" pos="18:1:1" line-data="           COPY CGPX001.">`COPY`</SwmToken> statements for including external definitions and specifies the organization and access mode for the files.

```cobol
           Window             is class "wclass".

       INPUT-OUTPUT SECTION.
       FILE-CONTROL.
           COPY CGPX001.
           COPY CGPX005.
           COPY REPX002.
           COPY REPX100.
           COPY REPX103.
           SELECT WORK ASSIGN TO VARIA-W
                  ORGANIZATION IS INDEXED
                  ACCESS MODE IS DYNAMIC
                  STATUS IS ST-WORK
                  RECORD KEY IS CHAVE-WK = FUNCIONARIO-WK FUNCAO-WK
                  ALTERNATE RECORD KEY IS ALT-WK =
                     NOME-FUNC-WK FUNCAO-WK WITH DUPLICATES
                  ALTERNATE RECORD KEY IS VLR-REPORT-WK WITH DUPLICATES
                  ALTERNATE RECORD KEY IS FUNCAO-WK WITH DUPLICATES.
           SELECT RELAT ASSIGN TO PRINTER NOME-IMPRESSORA.

Similarly, the <SwmToken path="src/rep/rep203.cbl" pos="17:1:3" line-data="       FILE-CONTROL.">`FILE-CONTROL`</SwmToken> paragraph in <SwmPath>[src/rep/rep203.cbl](src/rep/rep203.cbl)</SwmPath> defines the files and their attributes, including the printer assignment for the report output.

```cobol
           Window             is class "wclass".

       INPUT-OUTPUT SECTION.
       FILE-CONTROL.
           COPY CGPX001.
           COPY CGPX005.
           COPY REPX002.
           COPY REPX100.
           COPY REPX103.
           SELECT WORK ASSIGN TO VARIA-W
                  ORGANIZATION IS INDEXED
                  ACCESS MODE IS DYNAMIC
                  STATUS IS ST-WORK
                  RECORD KEY IS CHAVE-WK = FUNCIONARIO-WK FUNCAO-WK
                  ALTERNATE RECORD KEY IS ALT-WK =
                     NOME-FUNC-WK FUNCAO-WK WITH DUPLICATES
                  ALTERNATE RECORD KEY IS VLR-REPORT-WK WITH DUPLICATES
                  ALTERNATE RECORD KEY IS FUNCAO-WK WITH DUPLICATES.
           SELECT RELAT ASSIGN TO PRINTER NOME-IMPRESSORA.

# Data Division and File Section

The <SwmToken path="src/kello/rep203.cbl" pos="35:1:3" line-data="       DATA DIVISION.">`DATA DIVISION`</SwmToken> and <SwmToken path="src/kello/rep203.cbl" pos="36:1:3" line-data="       FILE SECTION.">`FILE SECTION`</SwmToken> paragraphs include <SwmToken path="src/kello/rep203.cbl" pos="37:1:1" line-data="       COPY CGPW001.">`COPY`</SwmToken> statements to bring in the necessary data structures for report generation.

```cobol

# Report Generation Process

It includes opening and closing files, initializing totals, and performing system calls to handle data processing and report generation.
