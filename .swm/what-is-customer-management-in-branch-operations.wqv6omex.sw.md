title: What is Customer Management in Branch Operations
---
Customer Management refers to the processes and systems used to handle customer data and interactions.

It involves managing customer contracts, personal information, and transaction records.

Customer data includes details such as names, addresses, contact information, and identification numbers.

The system also tracks customer transactions, including contract numbers, payment statuses, and transaction dates.

Customer Management ensures that all customer-related information is organized and accessible for business operations.

Customer data includes details such as names, addresses, contact information, and identification numbers. For example, the file `CGD999` contains fields like `CODIGO-CG99` and `COMPRADOR-CG99` to store customer codes and names.

The system also tracks customer transactions, including contract numbers and payment statuses. For instance, the file `CRD999` contains fields like `CLIENTE-CR99` and `SEQ-CR99` to store customer IDs and transaction sequences.

Payment statuses and transaction dates are tracked using fields like `DATA-VENCTO-CR99` and `SITUACAO-CR99` in the `CRD999` file.
